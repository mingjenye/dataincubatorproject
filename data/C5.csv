For dinner tonight, I really wanted a salad because I haven't much fruits or vegetables all day today since my husband and I were stuck in the car driving all day from Oregon this morning.   So I decided to stop by here to order the following:  Southwest Grilled Chicken Salad- This salad comes with a small amount of yellow corn &amp; black beans, Romaine lettuce with some general salad mix (dark green leafys), a few thinly sliced carrot pieces, a small amount of raw shredded cheese and south west seasoned corn chips. South west dressing is on the side in a very large dressing pouch. I had ordered this entree a few times and I felt that the salad portion of salad was on the small side and seemed to be smaller than usual.   Double Cheeseburger- Pretty standard, but my hungry husband devoured it.  ----------------------------------- (Total= $8.31 after tax)  We made our order via drive through and the wait was pretty long which surprised me because there was only 1 person at the register inside.

Aren't these supposed to be open during business hours? -The fry boxes were barely squeezed open (this is was the first part of being nickel-ed and dime-ed) Arggghh!  See picture, none yet eaten!  I figured this was intentional as store was crowded and this I figured is why they were stuffed in bag- I would have noticed if on tray.  These were less than half full.  -What I learned much later, when reading the receipt is that my two for $4, half full fries were actually charged at the regular price of two medium fries!  So another $0.30 extra, but what bothers me about this most is that I clearly told the clerk 2 for 4 or whatever, why would their registers even allow this and it dawned on me....$0.30 x millions sold per day is a lot of money for McDs.  I see a class action here!   Overall food was tasty, but the other things so turned me off, last straw  for me and reason we now search for (in and out) or (the habit) is over this crazy menu issue.  Hwy 99 from now on...there's an In-N-Out on the way.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-colusa?osq=McDonald%27s&start=09,0,1/27/18,1,"Easy as 1,2,3 menu, sucks.

I actually went through this place TWICE in one week as I was driving north and then back home. I decided I would combine my experiences-  1st trip- Despite having just read a Buzzfeed article on the amount of chemicals and artificial junk put into a strawberry shake here, I went ahead an ordered on. Received said shake and my experience was as follows: employee hands me shake dripping in melted milkshake and mysterious red juice, I take shake and as I am moving the shake from my left hand to my right hand to set it in the cup holder, the lid comes flying off and the cherry that was placed on top of the shake falls onto the floor of my car. Driving away I reached into my bag for a napkin to wipe up the sticky mess that was all over my hands and car and to my dismay, there were none to be found. 2nd trip- against better judgement I went through again, this time ordering a cheeseburger (I know, don't judge me. I was starving). Received order, opened up, only to find that the plastic yellow garbage they are supposed to place on top of the burger (I know, that's what I get for going here in the first place) was not even on my burger, but rather melted to the paper wrapper. Instead of the normally small chunks of onion that are sprinkled on top of the patty, I received a full, thick chunk of uncooked onion on top of the burger, and no pickles (fine I hate pickles anyway). My fries were not only cold, but they were soggy and brown. My drink had about 2 sips and the rest was ice.

If you've had a bad experience here take the time to read through my review.  I would like to start off by saying this location is a very busy, off the interstate multi-million dollar McDonalds. Unfortunately the general manager here, Irma, is a complete moron. She's a nice lady at the root, but is incredibly incompetent when it comes to leading a team that fits the needs of a store of this magnitude. The only reason she is the boss is because she has been working there since she was 16 and somehow managed to make her way up the ladder. She promotes and assigns people to stations based on personal relationships and not merit. She micromanages to the point that the staff is so confused about the goals that it's utter and compete chaos. And worse of all all the staff there is immensely undertrained. My first day there was the Saturday before Thanksgiving, and I was thrown at a computer taking orders with absolutely no prior knowledge of McDonalds and the food they sold. After that I had to figure everything out myself, and was constantly reprimanded for not following McDonalds protocol. We were told to be friendly and take the time to make sure everything was made right and up to par but were only given 90 seconds from the customer ordering, to leaving with their food to do so (and we were yelled at if we went over our time).  If you ever come to this location and have a bad experience don't bother calling and telling Irma because she'll more than likely laugh and make fun of your complaint with her staff (I speak from experience, I had to kiss her butt in order to get more than 15 hours a week). I suggest calling the corporate office, or finding the number for their Yuba City office who is Irma's direct higher up.

One might think that given McDonald's current dwindling market share they would make an effort not to drive away customers, not to INTENTIONALLY produce food that could not be eaten and may have been so loaded with salt as to represent a health hazard to anyone eating it.  In the shopping area as this McDonald's is a Jack in The Box and a Carl's JR.  The burgers fries at McDonald's are not so unique that they can not be replaced or in fact improved upon at either of the other places.

So from now on, I will have to go in to the store to make sure they get it right. These issues only started happening within the past 6 months or so, so maybe something has changed for the worst recently.  Here's the situation: I order a Quarter Pounder Deluxe meal every time. I typically order it with no pickles or onions, but I've started not making it a special order, so that I'll maybe actually get the right thing. That doesn't work. 3 times out of 5 they give me a regular quarter pounder with cheese instead of the Deluxe. Which means no mayo and no veggies other than pickles and onions.  I even order it by using the meal combo number and they still give me the wrong burger. I sent my boyfriend to get it for me last night, he said the lady told him ""the regular quarter pounder with cheese is cheaper"" he said ""no it's fine"", they still gave him the quarter pounder with cheese instead of the deluxe. Are they trying to save on lettuce and tomato or something? Why would they downsell that? They also shorted us an order of fries last night. And one of the few times when they actually did give me the deluxe... it was missing the burger patty and cheese! It was just mayo, lettuce, and tomato on a bun! I was on my lunch break at work so I couldn't just go back and get the correct order so I threw some fries on it and had me a fry sandwich.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-yuba-city?osq=McDonald%27s&start=0219,8,3/3/17,5,This McDonald's has NEVER messed up my order and the staff is very polite.

To start, a friend and I pulled into the drive thru and up to the speaker to order. We ask the girl for six egg mcmuffins, but we needed two without Canadian bacon. We had to repeat this about five times to her as she kept asking about sausage mcmuffins (an honest mistake, whatever). After multiple attempts to explain what we needed, she was not understanding and rudely asked us to pull up to the window because ""she couldn't understand us"". We eventually got up to the window, where she finally was able to take our order. We then pulled up to the second window, when a guy kindly told us that our food would be a minute and we should pull up on the side to wait. We waited maybe five minutes (no big deal at all) when a woman comes up (very closely) to the window with our food. We roll down the window only to have this woman LECTURE US on how inconsiderate it is to order breakfast food after 11am (even thought McDonalds CLEARLY advertises all-day-breakfast!) because the bfast food is made to order. (Side note: In N Out ALWAYS does made-to-order, but you don't see them bitching at customers about their job!). After a worthless two minute lecture, we finally drove away with our food. As we're driving away I look at all the egg mcmuffins and they all have Canadian bacon. This happens to me often, and it's an honest mistake. So we turn the car around, walk inside, wait in line, and the girl at the register goes to get a manager. Now let me tell you, this manager was beyond rude. After the girl at register had told her about our issue, the manager did everything in her power to make us wait for her. After waiting for five minutes for this woman, she finally rudely tells us to come over. ""What's the problem?"" she says in a rude tone. We repeat the situation, AGAIN, and instead of apologizing or offering us compensation, she tells us to give her two of the mcmuffins, throws them away right in front of us, and has one of her employees give us the new ones. Never an apology from this manager, just a crap attitude towards two polite customers over her stores mistake. We never acted rude or impatient, we smiled and assured them the order mess up wasn't a big deal, because it really wasn't!

We left without ordering after experiencing this cesspool of filth and nastyness. We watched for a few minutes and the young manager was struggling to keep things going as it appeared that some of his staff were missing. We the guests talked about how, in our opinion, the owner must be a real peice of work givin the lack of support or care that the place could be so nasty and filled with flying guests. After all that many flies dont get there overnight. in our opinion, if you value your health and the health of your loved ones keep going and DONT STOP HERE. being in the medical field we know bad things were getting in the meals ... uck    FUN FACT ABOUT FLIES: 1. Maggots (worm stage) hatch and eat the dead meat, then pupate before hatching as adult flies. They reproduce wherever and whenever they can and then lay their eggs or larvae (when viviparous) directly on food the offspring will eat. Being this food or wounds. Flies can eat virtually anything organic.

After waiting for 23 minutes my order shows up on the counter without a word from the disinterested young female server, the nonverbal implication is take your food and go away - but my fries are missing. When I tell her, she looks up at the monitor several times and asks for my receipt (first time in my collective McDonald's experience that an order item has come into question, perhaps she thinks I have entitled myself to free fries after waiting so long for 2 Happy Meals, and a coffee (and a missing large fries) - typically a McDonald's employee could care less but this server is on a mission.  After receiving my dubious fries order unceremoniously, a fuse has finally tripped, and I share with the server know how disappointed I am, (I know, it's McDonald's) the delay, the callousness, and my very credibility called into question. My feeling matter don't they?   Before she can respond, a smug baby-faced fellow customer, 13 maybe, with limp asymmetrical hair and an insufficient attempt at grungy-skateboard-rat-kind-of-look, takes it upon himself to intervene, due no doubt to his keen ability to survey a scene and ascertain victim from perpetrator.

At this point seizing the opportunity to diffuse the situation the manager yells ""Call the police!,"" clearly intuiting that my missing fries did not merit complaint, which justified the ""he's just a kid she kept saying"" championing ""Miss-who-gives-a-rip.""  Others joined in, my initial concerns regarding good service were trampled upon, how dare you complain they said, where do you think you are?  What topped it off after the Sheriff interviewed everyone, and ascertained that it was a big waste of his time, was when the server yelled ""thank you!"" out the door to her young defender, the Defender of Mediocrity, bless you for standing up for my self-absorbed how dare you complain customer sucks but I am young and know better attitude.

I hadn't been in a couple months for all the reasons above, so today I thought, give it another shot. Big mistake! I was there before 3:00PM, it was not busy. When I went in there were 3 people ahead of me in line. 25 minutes later after pleading with the clerk to help me, I finally got to order. I had to repeat my order 3 times and the lead person had to help the clerk twice to enter my simple Happy meal order. At that time there were now 8 people behind me in line. I asked what the problem was, the clerk said they were short on help. Managers/owners, get it together! It's not all about the money and profit.

My favorite today is Quarter Pounder Deluxe because of the fresh tomatoes and lettuce. The fries had gone through changes because of the health pressures. I did love the ""old fries"" but now I'm used to the new fries. In our town, we now have a choice of garlic fries and it seems not so good as expected. I had it today and it was not fresh. The fries were cool and the garlic was thrown on top of it. This is not good because this item will now be one the list that is eliminated. If it is done right, it would stay. Also, I believe McDonald's should just stay with their theme of hamburgers. I find the best success story is In-and-Out Burger because they serve what they are good at.

The girls were obviously going to have happy meals, I think that's the best thing MickyD's has. Now with apple slices in a sealed plastic bag. Like an in-flight meal. Drive through worked great today, the less work the better. We ordered the two happy meals and a Big Mac for me. I remember liking them as a kid during long road trips. At the second window, we received the two happy meals and they dismissed us. I didn't budge, because I still wanted the BigMac I paid for. By the time that came, my daughter's friend was disappointed with her toy, because she already has that one. She says that she's been to McDonald's one hundred times. Thank God they could switch out the goose toy for the puss toy. I drove home, and opened the BigMac. I approached it with caution. (food poisoning from McDonalds twice in the distant past {and not in Kiev})  The bag it came in said that the BigMac is all about the sauce. I was about to taste a product, not a burger, and keep an open mind, after all, people buy millions of these things, right? The product was very sauce forward. In fact, that's all I tasted. The body was unmistakable McDonalds bun and with a lettuce finish. Hint of pickle. I had to look where I bit from to see if there was meat. Yes. There was a grey strata approximately 3mm thick at the first and second inter-bun levels. One had American cheese on it. I completely forgot about that. I don't think I tasted it.

McDonalds ideal for families seeking cheap, rainy day entertainment, or travelers on 101 with rambunctious kids in need of a pit stop.  The Windsor McDonald's on Redwood Highway is clean, safe &amp; well-maintained. The servers are friendly &amp; seem genuinely kind. Most of them really ""get"" kids, indulge you with sympathetic smiles &amp; comments when the rugrats act up, &amp; remember to ask whether the happy meal is for a boy or a girl &amp; whether the child is age 3 or under so they include an appropriate toy (Happy Meal toys for infants &amp; toddlers are fun &amp; child-proof).  You do need to double-check your order to make sure everything's there -- they especially tend to space the caramel dipping sauce for the apple slices -- but I'm okay with that, because the servers here are so hard-working &amp; conscientious &amp; do a great job overall. Just inquire nicely about any problem that arises &amp; they'll help you.  The playground is located in an indoor enclosure and resembles a giant Habitrail for kids instead of hamsters, with a series of connecting tubes, ball pit, slide, and pretend rocket ships. Just make sure your child is wearing socks (hopefully the kind with rubber treads on the bottom), because these are required for safety &amp; health reasons. No socks? No problem. You can purchase them at the counter for the nominal fee of $1.00.   I used to loathe McDonalds &amp; everything they stand for ... but they've changed a lot over the past few years &amp; -- as a parent -- so have I. Their food has gotten a lot healthier &amp; yummier (just avoid the fries). McDonalds' happy meals &amp; other children's offerings are a LOT more nutritious than what you'll find on the children's menu almost anywhere else -- but they still seem to maintain the same immense appeal to children that they've always had.  And, really, when you're a parent &amp; want to go out for an inexpensive meal, all you really want is a place with decent food where you can relax while the kids have fun. There are no annoying video game or carnie rip-offs here, just a fun, varied &amp; low-tech play structure with lots of fun places to climb, hide &amp; pretend for the older kids; &amp; a small activity center with a soft, spongy surface, amusingly distorted fun-house mirrors, &amp; an assortment of attractive blocks which spin &amp; stack on rods &amp; can be assembled into patterns for the younger set.

This comment prompted us to write this review.  It is all about consistency in speed, quality of food, customer experience and atmosphere.  My husband mentioned to me long ago that Starbucks is the McDonald's of coffee.  It seems this has evolved into McDonald's hoping that one day it can become the Starbucks of fast food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-corning-2?osq=McDonald%27s&start=20416,13,10/4/10,1,Lame sauce.

Failing that, they then coerced me into taking the extra meal rather than throw it away as I requested, which, if you didn't get it already, tells you how incompetent they are.

Mobile App &amp; Pay.  Everything went fine using the app until I arrived at the restaurant.  The benefits of the app are somewhat limited since your order is not transmitted to the restaurant until you arrive and go through additional steps.  This is where the App failed miserably.  When I entered that I was at the restaurant and chose to pick up my order at the counter the app failed to transmit the order.  It did charge my credit card but did not send in my order.  Ultimately I was charged several times for an order that was never transmitted.  Restaurant Experience:  Restaurant was not very clean, tables were not clean and the floor not swept..  No employees were working at the register or at the counter for mobile orders.  It took approximately 5 minutes before anyone came to help.  I showed the employee my order code (as instructed in the app) and also showed her the texts messages showing my credit card had been charged multiple times for an order at McDonalds.  She offered no help and told me it must be my error as they never received the order.  She told me I probably ordered at the wrong restaurant.  I showed her the app showed it was at this restaurant and she just shrugged.  She told me charges on the credit card would need to be resolved with my bank.  I asked about my food and she told me no order was received.  I tried to show her the order and code for the order but she was not interested.  No attempt was made to offer service.  This was a small order and she did not make any attempt to provide me food or offer any resolution.

Whenever I go there, I usually get their Buffalo Ranch McChicken ($1), and their 20 piece McNugget is a must. McNugget comes with amazing dipping sauce, ranging from BBQ sauce, honey mustard sauce, and sweet and chili sauce. Now they have this new habanero ranch sauce. Definitely give it a try, if you want to spice things up with your nuggets.  I am sure eating those nuggets and McChicken will make your throat a bit dry.

Me and my Gustave slowly made our way through the dark but welcoming drive thru at 11 PM, greeted by a cheery and obviously not half-asleep or half-stoned employee. We WERE NOT ambushed by a homeless man which usually happens at a McDonald's drive thru at this hour. SUCCESS!!!  After diligently taking our order like a French waiter at a 3 star Michelin restaurant, the friendly employee beckoned us to pull further into the magnificent drive thru, as if we were two contestants on the Love Boat. While asking for our pay, she did NOT over charge us or mix up our order with the horny teenagers in the car in front of ours. SUCCESS AGAIN!!!  After we got our food, my diligent Gustave carefully inspected my Ice Tea with 50 creams for traces of worker-spit. NO SIGNS DETECTED!!!! By this time, we were both bursting with joy at our good fortune at choosing this obviously superbly run McDonalds. Seriously folks, if you live in a different state, and you want to patronize the world's best McDonald's, you ABSOLUTELY NEED to plan your next vacation here at Davis California, where dreams come true at the McDonald's on Chiles Rd. Seriously, if enough people have interest, we shall plan a campout here in this parking lot and use this McDonalds to fulfill our hopes and dreams.  As Gustave and I pulled away from this McDonalds, we shared a intimate look, with complete understanding between us that we have just experienced a slice of gourmet heaven. There were tears running down my eyes and more are a-coming as I remember this fond memory with euphoria. A perfectly made order, without a single order missed or unintentionally added.

We dined in because we just wanted to sit and chat for a bit.  We I ordered a big Mac and and didn't realize until I over heard the girl at the counter that they didn't have any middle buns.

Let me tell you.  I use to visit this location very often. Actually I probably spent an average of 60.00-80.00 dollars a week here until I just could not stand the poor customer service anymore. Let me explain.  I typically like to buy a 20 Chicken nuggets along with a burger or fries or a drink for myself. Typically my bill would be about 10.00 on up depending on if I was buying just for me or others.   The Elkhorn Mc D's generally is good, well average. I've had better and I've had worse. The problem I constantly have though is a simple request. That request is that I get 4 packs of sauce typically sweet and sour with my order instead of the 3 they want to give you to save costs for a 20 piece order. Now everyone knows  packet of sauce lasts for about 5 nuggets. So why Mc D's tries to cut costs and give only three packs is just wrong, it's bad customer service. But I understand cutting costs.   However what I don't understand is why even after asking for that extra packet, sometimes even being charged extra for it! Even though Mc D's even says the first one is free. What I don't understand is why I rarely get it with my order? I even made the effort to make sure it's clear being very polite that I want 4 sauces even having the order taker put the extra one on the order screen but when it's time to get my food the extra sauce is not there. Now after many, many times of this and trying many things to make sure I get it which to be honest is a real pain in the ass rather then just getting 4 sauces for all order automatically instead of 3 which is clearly not enough.   So how does a Sweet and Sour sauce cost 3120.00 or more? Well after literally years of playing this sick game and coming out the loser more often then a happy customer. I just stop going here as often as I once did. As a matter of fact I rarely go here now and stopped getting the 20 piece Chicken Mc nuggets so that I don't have to hassle with a order being wrong. Until today. Yes today the drive thru was empty and I was hungry. Instead of walking in to Food Source which is in the same parking lot to get a fully roasted Chicken, a soda and some chips for less than the cost of a 20 piece nuggets and 2 cheese burgers. I made the mistake of going to McDonalds. Well guess what I ordered 4 packs of sweet and sour and went to get my order and forgot to check my bag to make sure my order was correct (something a customer should not have to do!) When I left and was looking forward to eating food I've avoided now for about a year or more I was very disappointed again to see I was shorted my sauce. Now I know a sauce may seem like a small thing to stop doing business with a company for. But after awhile of regular poor customer service it's a sign the management and people don't really care about the customer experience in my opinion and experience and it's time to find other places to do business with. And that is exactly what I did! I took my 10.00 or more per visit 3-6 days a week, a average of 60.00 a week, to the competition. Now if you multiply 60.00 a week x 52 weeks a year what did that Sweet and Sour sauce cost Mc Donald's easily 3,120.00 a year!   Now I can't be the only person this happens to who has had enough of this poor business practice to short customers of their order's so the loss probably is more since I am sure other's who've had enough also found better places to spend their money.   I just hope Mc D's reconsiders this practice and give 1 sauce for ever 5 nuggets like they do on say a 10 piece order by itself. Why do they give 2 sauces on a 10 piece but only 3 on a more expensive 20 piece order? Stop with cutting corners and just give the customer a great experience it's not that hard. I hope ownership and management really figure out a way to solve this problem. Until then it will be at least another year until I spend my hard earned money with this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-rio-linda?osq=McDonald%27s&start=0750,20,5/24/17,2,"I've been going to this McDonalds for a long time, and I've had the few problems others have had such as a messed up order which has never been a huge deal to me, I can usually fix it on my own or get it fixed.  The reason why I am giving it 2 stars is because of some recent events that have happened that I feel need to be addressed.   The first one about a month ago I was in the drive through getting a drink and upon receiving my drink I noticed there was something that looked like blood on my straw and the top of the drink, sure enough it was. I did not take a picture of it because I noticed it when we were at the window and let the employee know, she got me a new one and realized her finger was cut open I saw her get a band aid there and then. My other reason happened today. I have been really sick and was really hungry so a roommate took me to get some food. I got a Big Mac, when we got home I took the pickles off like usual and noticed my patty was all kinds of torn up, like it had been thrown around. I was whatever about that thinking maybe it just got stuck to the grill. I started to eat my burger, the patty was cold but I was hungry. Then I saw a huge piece of plastic sticking out of my burger. I sat it down after that. I could not eat another bite.  I called the manager and they were nice but I feel like the employee who made the burger didn't care to make sure it was properly made and when it comes to food that scares me.  I usually choose this McDonald's over other ones because it's closer and is usually less problematic.

We were tired from a long drive, and in dire need of some breakfast. After paying at the window, I saw one of the male employees dumping the hot coffee machine's filter into the trash. He then grabbed a new coffee pouch to refill the machine. Instead of tearing the pouch open like anyone else (knife, scissors, or bare hands), he bit down on the corner and ripped it open with his TEETH! This was probably an isolated training issue, but who really needs to be trained not to open food products with your teeth? Isn't that common sense?! He did this with no shame, no hesitation, and in clear view of the drive-thru customers. I was too tired and hungry to complain, especially since none of us ordered any coffee.

I order breakfast from McDonald's maybe once a month or so and I have never had any problems. The morning people tend to be quite friendly and are fast when it comes to giving their customers food.  For the most part however, I go to McDonald's for dinner more often than I do in the morning. I also want to mention that majority of the time that I go there I dine in. Recently they remodeled this location and have added electronic kiosks so that the customer can order their food from there. In addition they added new floors as well as tables and chairs.   Now I know that this may seem like a good thing, but ever since they remodeled I feel as if their staff especially those who work in the afternoon or late at night have gotten careless. For one thing the kiosks are a bit tedious. For example, if you want to use a coupon or pay with cash you need to go over to an employee so they can ring you up the normal way. Also if you have ordered a drink, you need an employee to provide you with cups.  Since this location has remodeled you would think that the employees would want to keep it looking nice and clean for their customers. Well to be completely honest they haven't been doing that at all. I went in today to order dinner which I did from the kiosk and got a cup from an employee. Then I went over to the soda machines and I noticed that the floor around the machines as well as the counter top was very dirty and sticky. Since they have kiosks at this location shouldn't that mean that there are more employees that are available that can clean? After getting my soda I went to sit in one of the booths, but they were all dirty with crumbs on the table tops. I looked at the other tables and they were the same way. I know a dirty table isn't that big of a deal, however I shouldn't have to clean it off myself because I am not an employee. Therefore I went up to the register and asked if they could clean the table off for me. The lady I asked then asked her co-worker to get someone to do it. Immediately I thought that she should've been the one to do it because she wasn't doing anything in the first place. I waited a few minutes and saw that they told an older female employee to do the cleaning. That to me seems somewhat rude. That gives me the impression that none of the young adults wanted to clean and the older employee was stuck with the task.

There is a door to the kids' area, so unless an older child or adult opens it, my kid cannot get out. There is also a family bathroom IN the play room, so you can leave your kids to play and use the restroom quickly. It's also great to change a diaper, or let little ones go to the bathroom alone. - They have the good soda machines, with a million different flavor combos - The employees are nice, and are especially accommodating for those with kids.

I was working real late, and pulled off at Alamo to fuel up the truck at the 76 station.  As the truck's tank filled, my digestive ""fuel tank"" told me it was empty.  Being a vegetarian, my fast food choices are limited.  I did not want a sandwich or anything like that, wanted something just a tad more enjoyable.  After the diesel pump snapped to a stop, I looked across the KFC to the McDonald's.  I have seen it before, several times, but never stopped in.  I thought, just for fun, I'll ask if I can get them to make some of their yummy oatmeal for me (it was like 9:00 PM).  I walked in and the place was nearly empty.  There was one wanna-bee gangsta with a full eskimo outfit on (seriously,  you could only see his nose) apparently waiting for food, and another wanna-bee gangsta kid eating at a table.    I half-way expected the kid at the counter to look at me like I was upside down (I'm real clean-cut and look out of place anywhere except pottery barn), but he greeted me with a smile and looked pretty respectable.  I asked if it was possible to get oatmeal late at night, he said ""Sure! We sell oatmeal all day!""  Awesome.. In my excitement, I ordered 2 of them and asked for some butter on them.  He said he would give me some on the side.  Great!  The kids working there were all nice and smiley.  Wow, that's a lot different from what I am used to at McDonald's.  It was pleasant!  Kinda wished I didn't have to take it to go and rush out like that.    The oatmeal was done nicely, well mixed, and the fruit topping was plentiful.  All in all, a wonderful experience from an otherwise ho-hum restaurant chain.  Whoever trains those kids, well done!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-vacaville-5?osq=McDonald%27s&start=401125,30,2/9/14,3,The neighborhood McDonalds.

This is the place where you can go and get good fries in there nice and salty and maybe some good chicken nuggets. That's about all this place is really worth going to.

The hours posted on Google and Yelp (at the time at least) were inaccurate and in reality the store was open, but for Drive Thru orders only.  After walking up and seeing this, I approached the Drive Thru windows, hands up, to be clear I wasn't looking for trouble. I made myself visible from more than 30 or so feet away and caught the attention of an employee who waived and walked away without opening the window. This happened a second time with a different employee. Finally, on the third attempt to get someone's attention, they opened the window to tell me they would not serve me, they gave no explanation as to why, and they slammed the window shut.  It was frustrating having walked there for nothing, but I assume the policy exists for employee safety, and I didn't intend to argue it.  A day or two later I came into the restaurant with my children and a friend. I mentioned to the Manager taking my order how I'd been frustrated with the refusal of service. He made no apologies and offered no thanks for my patronage. He said they don't serve walk ups as they're always ""homeless or drunk and never up to any good.""  Not sure if I looked homeless or intoxicated, and I didn't take it personally, but he was rude and it was embarrassing with my friend and kids there.  We got our meal quickly but my friend brought his back, as it was someone else's order. We then waited more than 15 minutes for him to receive an incomplete version of his actual order. 0-2. We got no apologies and ten minutes later when following up, the Manager offered him a partial refund as he didn't know when my friend's order would be ready. Still no apology, and all the while he was short and rude.  I've had several interactions with staff here and seen no attempt at warmth or customer support worthy of retention.

So the next day I ordered it without ice in it, only to be told they don't ever put ice in it! Well, this morning I found out why my orange juice has been tasting funny lately...  As I pulled up to the window I saw a lady putting orange juice into a cup from the machine. She filled the cup about half way, then she grabbed the overflow tray from the bottom of the machine and proceeded to pour the contents of it into the cup.  My first thought was, ""I hope that's not MY orange juice!"" And I had a momentary sigh of relief when she grabbed another cup and started filling it from the machine. I thought maybe she was getting some pulp out of the machine or something with the first cup. But then she poured some of that orange juice into the other cup and then put a lid on it and handed it to the window guy to give me!  I immediately told him I wasn't going to take that cup because it had dirty orange juice in it and asked for a cup filled completely from the machine.

I opened the box poured in some ketchup for fries and picked up what I thought was a big mac. There was literally no meat in there. How can you forget the meat patties on a burger. You have to be pretty damn stupid. I called and no one picked up. Of course! I decided to drive back the 5 min drive. When I got there I spoke to the person in the front and explained my situation. I can't believe he had the audacity to ask for a receipt! The person at the drive thru verified that was just there so they decided to replace my sandwich. I asked them to replace my fries which were by now cold and he asked a manager for the approval. The manager said we can only replace the amount you give us back. Are you serious? Your really going to be that petty for a box of fries that literally costs 30 cents for the company. I should have just threw the fries in that punks face.

So I basically paid $5.51 more for extra nuggets that I did not want.   Another problem was I asked for honey mustard to go with the nuggets and instead got 4 packets of pure honey. Seriously?

The customer service is always terrible.  I have had more than one bad experience with this place. I will not be going back.  Examples:  I ordered a mighty kids meal for my 4 y/o son in the drive thru.  Easy order - 6 piece chicken nuggets, apple slices, apple juice. I was asked If I wanted a girl or boy toy.  I said boy.  When I get home, he has a 4 piece chicken nugget, apple slices that are slightly moldy and smelled terrible when opened, and a girl toy.  Mind you, a Mighty Kids meal costs more than a regular Happy Meal, so yeah it was only a two nugget difference, but I paid for the difference.   Twice, I have gone through the drive through and have been asked to wait a moment.  As I am waiting, another car pulls up in the opposite lane and their order is taken immediately, while I am still let sitting there waiting. The first time this happened was about a month ago.  The second time it happened was this morning. Before the other car had come up, I had said Hello? Hello? - nothing.  After the other car pulled up and went forward I became angry. I pulled forward and when I got to the window I asked why I was told to wait and no one came back, yet immediately served someone else.  The man at the window stated he had told me to pull forward. No, he did not.  And in fact if he did, why wouldn't he tell me that again when I started saying ""hello"" instead of just leaving me sitting there with absolutely no response?  The drive thru is the slowest drive thru ever. I have waited anywhere from 7 to 15 minutes in their drive thru.   There are many other instances I could note here, but I wont.  I have kept trying this location because it is super close to my house, but at this point I think it's best to drive a little further if it means I'm going to receive better customer service, an accurate order and fresh food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-citrus-heights-4?osq=McDonald%27s&start=01434,38,5/13/17,1,"I'm writing this review as I wait for my fries and cheeseburger now.

This location has 2 sides you can drive through. I don't know if it made much of a difference which side we were on, but you can't read the menu very well on the left side. It was just too far away...and yes, I have very good eyesight. As the woman asked us through the box what we wanted, we politely said that we needed more time. When we were ready a moment later, I said ""Hello, we are ready."" When she took our order, you could hear the frustration and impatience in her voice, as we told her we wanted only mayo, ketsup, and cheese on our McDouble. She said, ""So you want me to add mayo?""  Yes... She didn't say anything after that. We just proceeded to the first window. At the window, she kept saying, ""So you want to add mayo?"" Yes. She laughed as if we ordered a McVodka... and then repeated our order, sounding sarcastic. I instantly felt uncomfortable and asked her to get her manager. When the manager, Hannah, came to the window, Hannah asked what was wrong... I started telling her that the girl taking my order was making me uncomfortable by being sarcastic about what I was ordering...and of course, that girl was trying to talk over me. So I stopped, and asked if I could finish talking...  The manager, Hannah, was clearly not in control of her employee. This girl was unprofessional, and rude. She doesn't belong in customer service. I hope she is spoken to and/or written up.

So I emaled through the website again.  Got another call a couple of days later.  Called back, left message, again and again.  Finally got a hold of someone.  Told her about my experience.  She said this location was getting a lot of complaints and that she was sorry.  Sent me coupons for 2 value meals.  While this only made up for 1/2 of my experience, it was a nice gesture.  So went in to use the coupons.  Was told there were only a selected few values meals that I could use the coupons for.  None of their specials, none of the ones with the signs in the doorway.  What made it worse was the service.  The girl at the register was nice enough, although obviously new.  It was the ""manager"" Whitney.  She was very rude.  At no time did she actually acknowledge that I was standing there.  She didn't explain anything.  She just said, he gets only 1-9.  At the very least, she could have acknowledged me.  So I make my order and I wait. And wait.  The place is empty, nobody there but I still wait.  While waiting, I hear Whitney complaining about her boss, customers, etc.  Another worker leaves to go on break and is screaming at the other workers.  I finally get my food.  My Big Mac was horrible. The wife and kids meals were fine.  But I can't believe how bad the service is here.

They have Big Macs for 2 for $4 everyday! Yup a huge sign on the window. You can't beat that. Usually they will take that sign down and put up another special. What McDonald does that.

The little African American girl. . Just don't know her name lol. She is a shift supervisor or something used to see her in the mornings before work when I got my coffee. She brightened my day! Such a sweetie. Everyone here is very nice the down side is it takes a while for them to answer the drive through. No excuses cause I used to work a drive through at krispy kreme. Worst year ever so I'm patient. But the staff is friendly and I love to see their smiles every time I come. Another con there's usually homeless people sleeping at their tables at night. Kinda creepy. They should secure their patio at night..,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-citrus-heights?osq=McDonald%27s&start=401529,39,6/5/10,5,"The McDonald's by my house is super slow and the coffee always tastes burnt, so I stop by this McDonald's occasionally on the way to work for an iced hazelnut coffee.
