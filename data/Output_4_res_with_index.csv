0,1,9/7/2018,4.0,I've been here. Average. I'm actually typing this review as i stand in line. The people work hard. Great!  My name is Ledio.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-chicago-6?osq=McDonald%27s&start=0
1,1,10/7/2018,1.0,If I could give zero stars I would. This McDonalds is two blocks from my apartment and yet it would be faster to go to one a few miles away. It's perpetually understaffed. This is the opposite of fast food and service is nearly non existent. Go elsewhere if you can.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-chicago-6?osq=McDonald%27s&start=0
2,1,9/24/2018,1.0,"I wish they would've put a sign on the door about not having decaf coffee today. Tell me they don't know when the stock is low to order more. It's the most convenient of course because of the current promotion. Then it's all a secret until you try to order it. They found it cheap to serve regular because decaf must be more expensive for them. Before doing any promotions they should have made sure they had more coffee. In the future whenever they feel like requesting more, look at them making your orders, cause they love to the old mix of regular and decaf to fulfill orders. Always keep an eye open and you'll go far. And there's a 95% chance you'll be missing some items from your order. Doesn't matter if dined n or out, or drive thru, you'll always be missing something from your order. The only reason I still go, is because it's in the neighborhood.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-chicago-6?osq=McDonald%27s&start=0

Cashier said no but when asking the manager, she waved her hand and said I have no idea. Like shoeing me away for asking a question because it does say on Twitter it is available....

The lady working came outside in the 30 degree weather to see if I wanted something else while I waited for my breakfast sandwich. So I was able to enjoy a fresh, hot cheeseburger while I waited for my bacon, egg and cheese biscuit. Very good, nice service and then when I finally got my biscuit they had also put a hot pie in the bag.

12,1,4/26/2018,1.0,"Holy crap, this is the worst McDonald's I have ever been to. I keep trying to go back and I don't know why. Every time I try and call corporate to complain. Last time I waited 20 minutes for a breakfast sandwhich. I was THE ONLY PERSON IN THE DRIVE THRU. It was a game at that point to see how long it would actually take as I watched the employees inside laugh and joke and do absolutely nothing. When it was finally ready, she opened the window and didn't even say ANYTHING. Not even a word, just handed me the bag after 20 minutes. Tonight, close to same thing. 16 minutes for a double hamburger. Only one car in front of me. Every car behind me drove away, probably 4 or 5 of them. I ended up leaving at the 16 minute mark. As I passed the window it was the same group of employees just standing around laughing. So congrats for hiring lazy ego driven employees who consistently lose business for you on a daily basis.

13,1,4/23/2018,1.0,"This has to be the worst McDonald's. The employees have an ""I don't care"" attitude. I am quite sure they get that from one of the Managers, I believe her name is Sabrina, or something like that. She is a bully that argues with customers, as she did with me. They were out of a flavor for a frappe I ordered, so I asked for another flavor instead. She said, ""you can't be changing your order"", stating she had to replace that flavor anyway. At this point I had been waiting for a while. I just wanted my frappe and leave. She continued to argue with me about this, therefore I asked for a refund. She tells me I will have to wait for my refund. I told her she was a horrible manager. Her reply ""Whatever"". How they allow her to manage is beyond me. I will never return to McDonald's because of her.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-chicago-6?osq=McDonald%27s&start=0
14,1,12/31/2015,4.0,"I had a very typical experience at McDonald's. I ordered, waited not very long, and got my food. I thought service was the usual - no one was rude, no one forgot my order, and no one messed up my order.  I only like all day breakfast for the hash browns. I could eat hash browns at any time of the day.  The new mozzarella sticks are probably not worth it. They're very small. With all the bars nearby, you should splurge and get mozzarella sticks there.  I like that there's a drive through.

20,1,6/16/2014,1.0,"If I could leave this place zero stars I would. Would you ever think that you would need to call ahead to your local mcdonalds to make sure you'd be able to get ice cream? Well you do here. Either their machine is down, or they are ""out of ice cream"". Most (not all) of the employees look like they're miserable to be there. Management has been known to chit chat and joke with their employees while customers are waiting to place an order or get their order. Cashiers scratch their heads and touch their faces before touching food. If I had any other fast food choice other than subway I would go there instead and NEVER go here again.   The mcd's on Chicago and state not even two miles away is like night and day with this store. It's amazing the difference two stores on the same road could be, but they are. It seems as if the owner of this particular store doesn't care much about it or what goes on there and it's a shame because it's the only one in the neighborhood other than subway. You'd think they would want their equipment working properly, inventory always stocked and their employees at least acting like they want to be there even if they don't.

I was shopping and discovered it when I went to grab the cash and it wasn't there.  Being that I wasn't given my change back, I also did not receive a receipt.  I immediately called to speak to the manager and let him know what happened, to my disappointment he pretty much was like ""well what do you want me to do about it?"".  I responded that they should have cameras that they can look at to see that I was never handed my change, and when that drawer was cashed out (assuming it had not been pocketed) it would have been over by that amount.  I was told that there basically isn't much they can do but that he would talk to the manager that night and see if they recall anything like that happening.  He said sometimes customers leave without their change and it'll be out in the safe with the receipt, and I added but that's assuming that the person at the window is honest about what happened.  He said they could do an investigation to look at cameras but that it would take a long time.  I received one phone call the Monday after advising that the manager that night knew nothing (big surprise).  I have yet to hear from them again and I know that I won't.  Unfortunately, I have to take it as a loss which means I paid over $20 for 2 lousy sundaes :(   Beware of your change people and make sure you get it back before you leave!!!  I won't be coming back because they've gotten enough of my money already!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-chicago-6?osq=McDonald%27s&start=20

How do they keep up that blistering pace all day?  2. Another Saturday went for breakfast - this time a bit later - 9am. The place was such a complete gong-show that I walked in the east door, assessed the area, and walked straight through the mob out the west door .. went to Dominicks and bought a 4-pack of Jimmy Dean frozen sandwiches .. The decision was genius. Including cooking time (2-3 Minutes on High in micro) .. I figure I saved myself at least 25 minutes.

We weren't really dressed for a sit-down, service-oriented meal and the two Starbucks we popped into were restroom-free (I HATE that,  btw.)  Imagine our surprise, then, to find that this place was clean and well-air conditioned and nicely decorated (for a McDonald's, that is.) We decided to get hamburgers and split some fries and got comfy in one of the boothes.  The personnel was friendly and it ended up being one of the biggest surprises of the day (the other was the fabulous apartment we just missed on in Wicker Park, but I digress.)  I seem to visit McDonald's every two months or so for whatever reason. I mean, you get what you get and you usually don't expect much more. I'm sure Vamsi's experience was totally different since he went at 11pm and I was there at noon, but if you've been anti-McD's for a while, maybe check it out? They're having a free ice-coffee promotion later this week, I think!

She is a bitter woman that does not know how to handle and talk to customers...I live in the neighborhood and my first bad experience with her was ordering something to go one day...I stayed one minute to argue and trying to make her understand that ""to-go means in a bag"", so I can carry all the items with me...she told me that they're not allowed to give those plastic bags away...and when I asked her ""Well what are you using them for then?"" and pointed to the stack that they had behind her... she finally had nothing else to say and gave me one...to be fair I would not ask for a bag if I ordered just a portion of fries, but I had several sandwiches , fries, a McSunday, plus drinks since the order was for me and my girlfriend, how would you carry those if not in a to-go bag?! I am usually a polite person, I try to be understanding but when i'm faced with stupidity, I can't agree with it! THE WORST PART COMES NEXT: Recently I stopped by the place after finishing work and went inside...I walk up to the counter and half way through this lady yells after me ""Hey you, excuse meee!""...no hey sir...hey you...like on the farm, no respect, no nothing... so I turn around and asked what happened, what is the problem...she got by the door and was shouting at me ""we're closed...we're closed...SHOUTING...not saying ""Sorry, unfortunately we are closing...I apologize!"" none of that...again, I'm understanding, if a place is closing I'm not ridiculous, I understand them...but when I'm confronted with this level or rudeness, I must say something! I don't even write reviews here, but this excuse of a manager deserves it... So I reply ""Well what about the people that are next to me by the register and ordering now, how am I different than them? It is not closed for them too? If you are closed then why are the doors not locked and why are you shouting after me already being in the restaurant? Are you locking the doors now and you thought you can throw me out, or what?"" ""We're closed...we're closed""...She was stuck on repeat! I also felt embarrassed because as she was shouting, and everyone turned at me, since I was close to the ""order here"" line. Then I reply...""How am I different from these people here in front of me that are just ordering? Please explain to me that? What about if I go outside walk to the drive through window (the drive through is open 24 hours), and I order from there...how is that different than ordering from here? Is it not going to be the same thing? I'm actually going to be faster than them cause there's no line at the window outside""...""We're closed...we're closed"" I swear, her batteries were persistent...I won't buy anything from this place anymore and advise people not to do so either...If she is on the shift and you encounter her, you will understand why I wrote this review! I don't expect 5 star service from a fast food place, but at least politeness...and no shouting or ""Hey you"" crap! I live nearby and used to be a regular, stoping by their place all the time, but now that's going to change...maybe I'll swing by one last time and buy that lady an ice cream to make her bitterness go away! It's also funny to see that there are other reviews here addressing her rudeness and bad service!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-chicago-5?osq=McDonald%27s&start=0

Tsk tsk   Price: 3 -they charge you for plastic bags, ketchup packers and god knows what else.

I agree with other commenters that the staff tends to have a ""bah humbug"" demeanor, some worse than others, but you can't expect everyone you encounter to have a big fake smile plastered on their face, can you?   I'm here more often than I'd like to admit since I work close by, and out of the many orders I've placed, only two have been incorrect--once they misheard and just put in the wrong item, and another time I asked for honey mustard in addition to the usual sauce, and I had to ask for it again before I left. Not a big deal, but the employee I dealt with through that whole order just didn't want to be there. A customer shouldn't be able to tell quite how much you hate your job. Really.   Over all, it's fast food, not fine dining. The food quality never worries me, the order comes up quick, and I regret it like I do every other fast food purchase.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-chicago-5?osq=McDonald%27s&start=0
142,4,2/18/2017,1.0,"I went in to buy a large order of food for my family. When I placed the order, I had issues with the cashier understanding what I wanted to order. He was new apperantly and did not have anyone to help him till the end. The cashier didn't know what items McDonald's has to offer or the basic promotions (the 2 for $3). After explaining myself more than four times, another employee noticed my agitation and came over to help complete the order. Once my order was ready to pick up, I quickly checked it and left, which was my mistake since I know this location often messes up orders. Once I got home and started to distribute the food to my family I noticed that I was missing two burgers. I then called that location to let them know of the issue and asked to speak with the manager. The managers name is Carmen. She refused to help me on the issue saying that she was the one that put it together and that she saw me check it and leave. I told her I did check it but did not count the items correctly. Her reply was that if I checked it I should of told her at the time something was wrong. How can you check a bag stuffed with 8 flat burgers without being in the way for the next customer and after a long stressful day at work? Again that was my mistake for not taking the whole thing apart. Once I told her I wanted to speak with someone higher than her since she was very adamant on not rectifying her mistake, she then told me that the reginal manager, Michael, was available. Once I was being passed over, Michael was supposedly busy out of nowhere and couldn't take my call. Then the manager Carmen told me that I can call the 1800 number, which I did and filed a complaint, or call tomorrow and speak to the other manager. Overall this is not the first time I had an issue with this manager on rectifying errors made by them and shorting the customers money and items. I am also writing a complaint on the BBB since this manager does not do anything but put up a wall and ignore customer feedback/complaints. If you have an issue call the corporate (18002446227) and file a complaint with the actual franchise owner since they cannot take care of thier own mistake per location level.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-chicago-5?osq=McDonald%27s&start=0

This McDonald's lives in this world of hipster laissez-fair attitude, so when something is wrong, the answer here is ""too bad.""  I went to this McDonald's the other night with my mom and ordered about $16 worth of food including two McFlurrys or soft serve with toppings dumped on top, stale chicken nuggets and 2 Diet Cokes. Only halfway through our meal did my mom notice her drink tasted funny... She looked at her receipt and saw the cashier made one drink a Coke Zero. I went to the counter for her and told Samantha, the manager, that the drink was wrong and I'd like a Diet Coke. She said the drink was half empty and I'd have to buy a new one. The shock on my face washed over her like she was a piece of smooth sea glass. My mom also tried to reason with her - ""Shouldn't the customer get what they actually ordered?!"" No. No you can not. Samantha then took my mom's receipt and threw it away. My mom asked for it back so she can officially complain. I give them credit for following up, but they're a lost cause.  It wasn't the $1.05 it would've cost for a new drink, it's that Samantha and her crew are the most unfriendly group people I've ever experienced and to eat their food again would be to poison myself with their abrasive unhelpful attitude.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-chicago-5?osq=McDonald%27s&start=0

This was a VERY unpleasant encounter with this manager. I have NEVER just sat in a McDonalds, or any venue and not ordered. I DO NOT LOITER and was quite offended that this person insinuated that.  In fact, I always order and take it home except this day I did sit for a a minute ( and earlier at breakfast I ordered my usual grub and sat maybe 5-7 minutes and took the rest home) or two as I completed my call, but I just got there and it was like this person appeared out of nowhere and started grilling me?
