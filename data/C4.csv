But we'll get to that later.  How the owners are able to keep their franchise is one of lifes great mysteries. Look at all the one star reviews and a pattern of truth emerges. The restaurant was dirty from the restrooms to the dining room. There were no less than two homeless people in the dining area. I'm not hating on the homeless I am hating on the fact that one of them was so high he was completely out of it and did not exactly give me a warm fuzzy feeling being there with my 6 year old grandchild.  The service was amazingly slow. If being slow was an Olympic sport they would have more gold medals than Michael Phelps. The staff seemed unhappy? I get it, you are working fast food but take some pride in doing your job well. My sister, a very successful banker got her career opportunity while working fast food and impressed one of the customers so much he offered her a job.   Now for the end of an unpleasant experience. The food arrives, my grandchild takes a sip of milk and states it tastes funny. Quick check of the cap shows it was expired for more than a week. Go to the  counter  where the manager was. She starts to get another milk and guess what? Yup, expired. Most of the milk wss expired, but she was persistant in her search and finally found a milk within freshness standards.

T-minus 9 months darn near to the date of my last experience here and I'm sad to say that the 1-Star review must stand at this point and time.   Molasses. No not on the menu but that is the speed or lack of speed at which the all the transactions appear to take place at this particular Galt location. I'm not special in this respect as I witnessed on both trips here each paying customer be treated the same way as well as the length of time from order placement to order completion to be the same: Looonnnnnnnnggggggg waits which suck it big time.

This is McDonald's and as such they should be used to the fact that by now people, especially people on a Saturday at oh say around lunch time are going to inundate them with drive thru as well as in-store purchases.   Solution: Hire more people, train hired employees more efficiently from the front end to the back end of the consumer experience. IE: Money exchanged for a service/product which includes speedy accurate service.   I do have a theory however as I grew up within this San Joaquin Valley and spent over 40's year in it.

For those young enough to remember this location had a playground in front. We're going back like 30 plus years though. Yay yay yay I'm 40 years young and still look good as fawk.  When I started  popping out kids like rabbits. I brought my three children. The playground was already gone and it was pre WiFi days. But that was okay though. I would tell my kids all the fun  that I had here.   Now I try to bring them but they never really want to come. Oh well, I still come here and reminisce about the beautiful moments I had here. With my Grandma and children.   This is Mickey D's.  So when you roll up you got two options. Choice one drive thru and choice walk in. I highly suggest if you come at night. Choose the walk in. Listen people, you're sitting ducks in the drive thru. This is the hood and Chit be jumping off in this beazy. Just keeping it real.   I look for the positive in everything but the outside excitement can overwhelm a person. Who never been here.  The service has been good and I never had a problem here. The food wait is standard wait times. The chicken Mc nuggets are too die for. Something about them drives me cray cray.  Mickey D's need to bring back that 39 cents cheeseburger days and 29 cents hamburger days on Sunday and Wednesday. Dude on my sipping days I would order like 10 of those mofos.

Well Holy Cow Batman the manager realized he needed to get to work and help the only 2 people who were even making an attempt to work...the cooks. Now the cooks, poor guys looked like they had a hard time multi-tasking but hell they tried!!! The GM is now walking to the sink area after she was so enthralled in the fountain machine.....STILL OBLIVIOUS TO WHAT IS NOT SUPPOSE TO BE HAPPENING ......THE STAFF PLAYING AROUND!!! I was waiting for that girl to take another picture with me at the counter so I could take a picture of her to post here!!! She finally took her seat with the employees who were at lunch!!! Then I'm asked again if I could be helped (from the girl who took our initial order) I pointed out how she did not indicate on the order to omit the items above and it was to be fixed and we were still waiting to  complete our entire order....30 whopping minutes later FINALLY!!! It appeared once the Manager got back his focus back the orders went through unfortunately it took our order to be incorrect and totally disregarded to get the flare in him moving again!!! It was slow too!!! With plenty of time in between the orders!!!  Someone made a huge mistake with this round because you would think that a site that is not only new but also near a busy freeway had a good rhythm in getting orders in and out in a quick fashion!!  This is so not the case here....RUN FOREST RUN UNLESS YOU HAVE A HALF HOUR OF TIME WAITING FOR FAST FOOD!!!

Their top menu items include: hamburgers, cheeseburgers, McNuggets, and French Fries. Currently, there are more than 32,000 McDonald's restaurants serving in 117 countries. More than 75% of McDonald's restaurant worldwide are owned and operated by independent owners.  One of the strength is the price. The price for buying food are very cheap and affordable. You can literally order a meal from a dollar menu and still get a full stomach meal in return. If you want to, you can order a hamburger along the size of your meal and a drink for no more than 10$.  Another strength is how quick and fast your food will come. It's pretty much a quick in and out. You order it and then you leave with a meal in your hands. A person can walk in, order the meal, and walk out with a meal for more than 6 minutes to say the least. Drive- through has the same concept except a person will be in the car.   The last one is a weakness, and that is the foods can be cold if being rushed. Since, McDonald is known for their hot and quick and easy food to the customers, they are also known for not properly heating the food correctly. Sometimes, customers would walk out with a meal in their hands not knowing the food is cold. This happened to me as well, and i do hope McDonalds notice this and fix this. We, as a customer, expect something good in return for paying.   Overall, McDonald is a popular fast-food restaurant. It's a rich business corporation, and it's a successful business.

Pretty straightforward order.  1. Big Mac meal medium with sprite 2. 10 piece nugget meal medium with a dr. Pepper  3. Bug kids meal nuggets with choc milk/apple slices 4. Mc double meal large with NO onions or pickles with Dr Pepper   I proceeded to ask if they still offered the shamrock frappe? The answer yes. So I got myself that.  Approached window to pay.. she thoroughly inspected the two $20 bills I gave her.  they gave me change. Next window she said everything was in bag, I asked for 2 extra sauces, being as I have 20 nuggets. They said no. So I paid the extra .60 for them (laughing) of course.  I left. Got home unpacked bags. Needing to be at school in 30 mins I was just handing food to kids.  I received instead of 10 piece nugget I was given a filet o fish. Instead of shamrock frappe, i was given a shamrock shake. Ok I'm upset I have to drive all the way back, I go in and ask for manager. I told her my original order and asked that she remake the whole order including drinks so nothing is cold. She immediately told me this is my fault i should have read screen, and I need to pay difference. I refused and said I spent more on gas coming a k and forth. The difference was $1.00 but at that point I was adamant they should chalk that huge loss up and just remake the food. She refused, she told every employee to never allow me back in, refused to give me her name! I told her listen we all have jobs and make mistakes just fix yours and no biggie.

Went through the drive through and chose the left-hand lane. Nobody greeted me and there were two cars who's orders were fully taken before anyone came on the speaker on my lane. When I asked why the lady said, ""Um, I was helping someone."" No apology, nothing. Got to the first window to pay and asked the lady to have a manager meet me at the second window so I could let them know what happened (the only way to fix issues is to address them with management so they have an opportunity to do something about it). Got to the second window where I saw the first girl approach a female manager and point towards our car. The manager looked over at us then proceeded to grab a bag and start filling an order (putting burgers/fries into a bag). The lady at the second window handed me my soda and then closed the window. Nobody came over. When I got home I called the restaurant asking for their store number (10700) and for the contact information for their area/district manager. The gentlemen on the phone was polite and asked me to hold. Another lady came on who spoke VERY broken English and acted as if I had just called in (I guess the guy who answered the phone didn't bother telling her anything before picking up). I asked the lady for the contact info for their area manager and was told I could not have it. I asked, ""Then how am I supposed to contact someone outside of this store to complain?"" I was then given what I was told was a corporate number and to ask for Debbie Hendrick (again, her accent was thick so this may not have been the real name she gave me). When I called the corporate number one of the options was to leave a complaint about a store for a person named Dennis. I left a long message describing the issue I had and asked for someone to call me back. I really hope someone does.

I understand that every trip there will not land when they fries were just cooked and I would expect maybe a 20 percent chance that I will get some bad ones. At this McDonald's I get gross, cold and soggy fries every single time. I am not kidding. I go to this place more than I should and I have never once been given fresh fries.   Another thing I like about McDonald's is that they always have good Coke. I do not know it if's different or no there but it always seems to taste better at McDonald's. This place drops the ball here too and the Coke always tastes like they hooked it up to the diet Coke by mistake or something. It's terrible.

The Iced Hazelnut coffee is to die for with xtra cream. I love !. They recently changed their small and large salad containers to crystal clear see thru types which makes it easy to spot if your lettuce is fresh or slightly turning brown from being kept past expiration sale date. I always check mine before i leave the Drive thru window because past experience was by time I was home and started putting away my salads, I noticed the lettuce was brown on the edges. Not good. So always check before I leave the DT.   I also noticed the salad portion sizes of the small salads has shrunk in portion size as opposed to what it was a few months ago. Salads look as if there is not more than a handful of lettuce in the container. Come on.. why do they have to short the salads? Lettuce is cheap. It just makes one think poorly of McDonald's that they would stoop to such tactics as to short the lettuce in the salads as if that is going to save them big time and the fact that we the people are not going to notice it??? Really?. I have asked the DT clerk to put more lettuce and she/he will always say I will have to check with my manager first and let you know. That undoubtedly leads to a visit from the shift assistant  Manager, which result is sometimes they will put a little extra lettuce filled up to the lid and sometimes result leads to a comment by the assistant Manager ""That's the way we make our salads here at McDonald's on Daniel St, Manteca, Ca."" Same comment from Assistant Manager at the W Yosemite Blvd, Manteca location. So I do not even ask anymore. I just get my salads as the other McDonald's on E Yosemite because they DO fill the salad container all the way full to the lid with lettuce and spring mix like it is suppose to be. And always fresh no brown lettuce either.   One late nite visit this past month to McDonald's Daniel St., I had asked for xtra mayonnaise in separate small cup for my McChicken's as they are always to dry. They wanted to charge me xtra 25cents for that. I said no thanks I would rather not pay xtra for something that other McDonald's are giving out free.   Another visit early this past year to McDonald's Daniel St, I ordered a large fry with my chicken wrap sandwich as part of the meal. I checked my order at the DT as always before leaving the window. And low and behold the large fry container was HALF FULL. I asked the employee to fill it up to top of container and she said I will have to run that by my Manager. So next thing, the shift assistant Manager, Janet, comes to DT window, she says that is the normal amount we put in the large fry container. I ask why? Most other McDonald's around here fill the fry containers full? She said its a management/corp decision. I said.. just like the up-charge for the xtra mayonnaise? She said...Yep!.. I am thinking... WT**F? is wrong with you people in Corporate McDonald land? Do you think we the people will not notice such portion shorts and protest? Which will lead to us not ever wanting to return to this McDonald's location again in this lifetime. And also will lead to us finally get so fed up that one has to speak out about it on not only at Yelp but several other social media sites to air our discontent of such one sided selfish greedy corporate tactics?   Other visits to McDonald's Daniel St later this year yielded the following:   Early 5a morning run to McDonald's Daniel St, for fast food before the morning breakfast rush yielded some very strange exchanges.... I asked for two items... an egg white, bacon biscuit with no cheese and a big breakfast with egg white, bacon and biscuit sub for the English muffin. I did not check my order and assumed that they would have gotten it right because I went over the order two times with the DT Window clerk to make sure she put in my order correctly. When I got home and took out my two items..I could not believe what they did to my order. The egg white, bacon biscuit had white cheese on it. The big Breakfast, the egg white was so minuscule and burned it was not edible and the biscuit was a miniaturized size of the normal biscuit size you get when you order an egg bacon biscuit DT takeout. I wished I had taken a picture to upload. Next time.  Summary: I would have to say that there is some downsizing of food portions a miss here at corporate McDonald land on Daniel St and West Yosemite Blvd, Manteca, Ca.. Wouldn't you? Not only that but several of the run in's with the Manager's here at these McDonald's tells me that they are playing it up to the upper Management and indoor security cameras as they are being recorded and monitored daily by whomever is assigned to review those security taped files. Probability RE: because the more up charges these Assistant Managers can score for their locations the more points they acquire in the process of moving up the Corporate ladder to upper management wouldn't you think? .",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-manteca-3?osq=McDonald%27s&start=60606,16,11/25/16,1,"I went to the McDonald's at 2050 Daniels St. Manteca, CA and had the worst experience with everything at this restaurant.

PLEASE make some changes, McDonalds!  Of course my kids enjoy McDonald's, but in comparison this store is the worst McDonald's in Lodi. The other Lodi McDonald's stores are really rather nice. Please note... The counter and dining room employees were great! They were very nice, helpful, hard working and efficient... I appreciated that a lot! But there are other big problems with this store.   First off, this store is very small, often dirty and incredibly HOT! They do not turn on the A/C high enough (even when it's 100 degrees outside!), as they should and the result is a group of sweating customers trying to eat their food...gross! When it's too hot in there it just seems more dirty, sticky and unpleasant for the customers (and I'm sure the employees too).   This store attracts a big group of homeless people that hang out inside and around the store parking lot (loitering). I guess it's because this store is by the freeway and next to a big truck stop. It makes it very uncomfortable to eat here with my family when there are many disturbed people talking to themselves, hanging around in the bathrooms, taunting others and asking people for money. They like to hang out inside the restaurant for long periods of time. Some of these folks have been quite aggressive and threatening. It would be fine, but you cannot allow ANYONE to behave with that kind of disrespect to your customers... or employees for that matter.    We decided to leave the store early (again), as to get the kids away from the aggressive men staring and commenting at us while we were trying to eat. It was very unpleasant for my family. And it scared the kids. I'm sure the McDonald's Corporation wouldn't be happy about this sort of thing at one of their stores. Maybe they need a security guard at this McDonald's store.   I like McDonald's (and Lodi) a lot, so I hope they can get a handle on this poor situation at this Banner Street (Flag City, Lodi, CA) McDonald's store.   Keep up the good work employees...I can tell that you work hard... even though you only get minimum wage. I respect that. And to the managers (and owners)... I really think you need to step it up! I KNOW for a fact that you can do a lot better.   Managers... make sure your franchise owner knows what is going on here.   Well, we'll see how it goes the next time we're in the area. Please work on these issues, so we don't have to skip this store for a better one.   Bottom line...   - Clean the store... inside and out! - TURN UP THE A/C!!! - Run off the aggressive people that loiter inside and outside the store. - Do not allow the loitering people to be aggressive towards your customers or employees.   - Clean those bathrooms! - Appreciate your hard working employees.  - Put napkins in the dining room, as you spend too much time retrieving napkins when they are requested.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-lodi-3?osq=McDonald%27s&start=20646,17,9/1/14,1,Food was Normal for what you can find here this is mostly about the bathroom.

This was the worst McDonalds, and possibly the worst dining experience I have ever had. Let me preface this by saying I don't expect much from McDonalds to begin with - if the facility were clean, well kept, food the appropriate temperature and staff competent, then I would give a five star rating. Unfortunately,  this was not the case. We stopped here because it was the first McDonalds we had seen in 20 miles and we feared we might not see another in another 20 - sadly, after leaving we saw three more McDonalds in the next town, all would have been a better choice. We walked in and the floor looked unswept, the walls dingy and the sound of screaming children permeated the entire establishment. When asked about the menu, the staff seemed completely clueless of what the offer. The soda machines had no syrup and flies were circling the lid dispenser area. When we actually were able to muster the attention of a harried-looking worker to inform them of the fact that the machine was empty, they responded with ""oh"" and had to be prompted to actually procure a diet coke. The drink we received was flat and had an odd flavor to it, disappointing. I asked for no cheese on my sandwich, and of course, when I opened the bun, a slathering of cheese was present. The food was lukewarm and the fries almost stale tasting with an almost fishy flavor. The ladies restroom had no toilet paper, no seat protectors and no paper towels - a fact I would have preferred to have known before drinking my off-tasting beverage. Suffice to say, I have never been so excited to get back in my car during a road trip.

DO NOT EXIT THE RESTAURANT from the play-place! For whatever reason, this Mc. Donald's is not smart enough to place an ""ALARM WILL SOUND"" or any sort of ""red tape"" on the door. It simply says, ""EXIT"" like any other door would! However, when you procceed to exit, the alarm will sound! Then, the employee's will come &amp; give you dirty looks &amp; yell at you, as if you somehow messed up? If the door had ANY SORT OF WARNING on it then I would understand why they're upset, but... in actuality, I SHOULD BE UPSET WITH THEM for not warning me. Now let's begin...    PROS: Morning staff (anytime before 8AM)  CONS: The rest of the staff. I've had them overcharge me &amp;/or get my order wrong 2-5 times I go, which is a lot when you put it into perspective. When you call to complain, the manager never seems eager to please you, nor the situation you were forced into by there employee's mistakes. Manager almost never compliments the customer with a free meal, or something exceeding the value of the mistake (which they should, considering I'm dealing with the mistake &amp; having to waste time/gas to come back at a future time to claim my mistake...)  Example: I ordered 2 Large drinks. I received 1 Large, 1 Medium (drive-thru) in a cup holder (I was unaware they were different sizes) until I got home. I called the manager to tell them they messed up &amp; the manager straight told me I was lying! This has happened more then once (where I was told I was lying, straight up) - I was told the employee specifically remembered giving me a Large. Therefore, I told the manager to review the cameras which would prove my point in case, the manager refused to waste resources on reviewing (which isn't a waste because it tells you your employee is dishonest while also clearing the customer) - instead she opted to refund me a free-Large drink. Just to make a point, I went back into the store 10-minutes later with the medium drink, to there surprise.  Another example. I ordered a meal with Big Mac. However, the woman misheard &amp; charged me for 3 additional Big Mac sauces, which equated to $1.00 extra! When I arrived at the ""pay window"" I asked the employee to reread the order to me, because I felt it was wrong. Instead of rereading the order, she swiped my credit card, then reread the order, not mentioning the 3 extra Big Mac sauces! When I arrived at the ""pickup window"" I seen the 3 sauces &amp; asked ""what is this?"" to my surprise I was told it's what I ordered. I told the employee it was not what I ordered &amp; I wanted a refund. Her response to me, ""No, you did order it actually..."" are you kidding me? Again, I was being told I was a liar, this time not over a phone, but in person! I know exactly what I ordered, if I said I didn't order it, then I didn't order it, who are you to dispute that fact?  For this reason, I try to avoid ""Indian Hours"" is what I like to call them. Because, it seems that after 8AM all of the Indians, Syrians, etc. begin work. It's always a group of them &amp; they're always rude, accusing you of lying, etc. - they treat this Mc. Donald's like a personal Mini-Mart. They treat the customers the same way they would at Chevron. They assume everybody is dishonest &amp; have no problem expressing those beliefs to your face, publicly in front of whomever, whenever. I'm not being racist at all, racism would be me making things up, nothing is being made up.  Unfortunately, customer service is a huge issue with me &amp; for good reason. I rate a place based on customer service before I do on food quality. Your burger doesn't have to be the best in town, you don't even have to be the best ""order taker"" - mess my order up 100 times for all I care, but at least take care of the customer!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-turlock-4?osq=McDonald%27s&start=20699,18,8/17/16,1,"This place is competent for a McDonald's but the late night manager,  An Indian woman late 50s is the worst!!!!!!!! and so rude.

We came here on a Saturday afternoon because I needed something quick before work. There are two lanes in the drive through and they say to pick any lane at anytime. We picked the lane on the right hand side. There was only 1 car ahead of us so we figured it we got lucky and would be through quick. WRONG. Much like the experience of a previous reviewer we sat at the order screen and waited to be acknowledged but no one said anything even when we talked into the screen ( calmly) to try and get someone's attention. We watched as 3 cars in the other lane put their orders in while we still just sat there waiting. We couldn't even leave because there was a car behind us and all the other cars from the drive through in front of us. 15 minutes later ... the longest I ever sat in a drive through...we finally arrived at the pay window  and explained we were never able to order.. no apology or explanation. We would have just drove off when we got to the front of the line but we were still blocked in and didn't want this fast food run to be for nothing. I was almost late for work. Be weary if you are in a hurry.     UPDATE: I don't know why I gave this McDonalds another chance. Within the last 2 months, I have tried to stop for breakfast after work around 5:30 AM. The first time, they said their system was down and they were unable to take orders. The next attempt a week or 2 later I pulled up to the drive through only to be told they were not going to open for another 20 minutes ( they open at 5 AM and it was around 5:30). This morning I attempted again. There was already a line of about 4 cars and lo and behold, they weren't even open, one of the customers in line even tried to go inside but the doors were locked, again around 5:30.

We ordered a small banana strawberry smoothie, 10 piece McNuggets, a Sprite, small fries and a McChicken sandwich. Well, the building may be new, but their quality control is as bad as ever.  The McChicken sandwich had 1/3 the lettuce it's supposed to have, and it was old nasty lettuce. The chicken patty was hard.  The smoothie was covered in smoothie on the outside of the cup. When I asked the chunky lil lady to please clean it up, she acted like she was doing me a favor. She slowly placed two paper napkins around it, and acted like she was going to hand it to me like that. What!!?? NO WAY! I asked her to wipe it off. She slowly turned around, holding it out in front of her to a coworker. Took another minute for them to figure out what to do. When she was through, she asked me, with plenty of tude, if it was good enough. Later, as my wife was trying to drink the smoothie, it was still spilling out. The thing was so packed with drink that it was pressurized! Yup, 6 napkins and 4 baby-wipes later... the mess was controlled.  The fries were put in the bag upside down, so of course, they were all over the bottom of the bag. The nuggets were a mix of warm and cold, which tells me they are too cheap to keep a fresh batch around. Of course, the cold ones were hard.  The only thing they got right was the Sprite....  There is a reason people get paid minimum wage. These people make the case.  EDIT: After reading through the other 1 star reviews on this dump, they reminded me of one other little annoyance. We were in lane 2 for the order, and I had to get the attention of the order takers. 2 other orders were taken before ours.

What happened: Pulled into the drive thru. It's a 2-lane drive-thru. A car ahead of us waiting to place their order and now a car pulls up bend us. The drive thru lane next to us though, about 5 cars get their orders taken when hubby gets out of the car to go see what's going on. He comes back and says he went to tell the person at drive thru that she was only taking orders from 1-line.  We finally pull forward, give our order, then get to the window to pay and hubby asks to speak to the mgr and girl gets all attitude saying she doesn't have to talk to us, closes the window on us. We can't even pay for our order now. Someone finally comes back to the window. My husband 1st asks his name (he likes to address people by their name), but Cliff (wearing a name tag mind you) asks why do we want to know his name? I ask if he's the manager and he says yes. Hubby tries to explain what happened while we were in line and when he came to let the gal know that she was missing the cars in the other line that we were in. I don't think Cliff heard anything after ""what's your name?"" He started with ""This is being recorded..."" From there it just went downhill....and fast. He kept interrupting hubby anytime he tried to talk at which point he finally said ""just move up you're order is ready"" and closed the window on hubby. Mind you we still hadn't paid yet. Pulled to the next window and the poor woman looked confused. She asked if we paid and we told her that we didn't get a chance to. That Cliff dismissed us and told us to go to this window that our order was ready. She asked us to hold on and went back and then came back with Cliff who was on the phone with who he claimed was the district manager and gave us our total. Hubby gave his credit card and asked to speak to him as well which Cliff refused. Hubby asked to get their name and number and Cliff again refused. At that point Cliff informed us he was calling the sheriff and at which point I called McDonald's customer service line.  For a manager, Cliff did not present himself as a customer oriented person nor did he display any characteristics resembling good customer service. Not sure what he expected to happen, but Sheriff came, hubby spoke with them, then they left after having Cliff provide at minimum the store# to hubby. I also by this time finished giving a report to customer service over the phone which let's face it never amounts to anything. It's a franchise. Owners won't do anything. I'm sure Cliff is normally a good manager but he let himself get hyped up by his worker who was already on the defensive.  For Cliff &amp; cashier: you both owe my husband an apology. For the franchise owner: some kind of reprimand should be given to both Cliff &amp; cashier.

Shouldn't personnel be filling up the straws and napkins after the first complaint? I even saw a customer being directed around the corner to get her napkins. I noticed a more than adequate staff that should be attending to problems like these. After waiting almost 15 minutes, someone who came in a while after me asked for her order and it was given to her immediately. I finally went up to the counter asking for my order, and the cashier actually tried to charge me again. I said no, I had already paid and told him how long I had been waiting. My order was then passed to one person, then another and then another, which in turn took another 5 minutes! Other customers that were there at the same time also felt this service was less than unsatisfactory. I also took the time to look at what would have been my place in line in the drive-thru.

She looked at the bruise and showed some concern that the other store wasn't calling. She said she would call over there and see what was going on and call me that evening. No phone call.

We have been going to this location since 2008, and have never been charged for the ice water. Never charged at any other McD's locations either. So when I asked for extra ice, the (female) cashier tells me that it'll cost me $1. I told her that I had never been charged for it before, and she said they always charge, because it's policy. When I tried to explain that I had just been there the day before and had not been charged, she got rude with me and mumbled something that I couldn't quite make out, and when I asked what she said, she wouldn't answer me. So I pulled up and asked for the manager, but of course she took her time going to get him, and when he showed up, he just stood next to her while she was looking at the cash register, not doing anything. Finally he asked what was wrong, and I told him what had happened, and how rude the girl was to me. He then told me that he'd been there for a year and a half and that they always charged for large water, because it was in a large cup as opposed to a medium cup. Plus, he was being just as rude and condescending as his employee..which is probably why she thought it was okay to be like that to customers. So, I told him to forget it, that I'd go somewhere the people weren't so rude. He didn't even care. I realize that if I never went there again, that it wouldn't hurt the business, but come on, what happened to curtious behaviour, and good customer service? These people need some more training on how to treat their customers.  I do have to admit that there are two people (a guy and a lady) who work there in the drive thru, that have always been super nice to me, I wish I knew their names so that I could at least give them some praise. Too bad they have a rotten boss, and cashier.  Anyways, I went to JACK IN THE BOX where they gave us an even bigger soda, (yes, it was $2.29) and a free large water, and were very cheerful about it, too. It wasn't just about the price, it was the attitude. If the manager told me that under the circumstances he'd give me the water for free, but I'd have to pay for it in the future, I'd understand, but he didn't, and he was a jerk for treating me the way he did.

The drive thru staff is always very nice and helpful and I've lived near this location for 9 years and have never gotten a bad attitude. Now the abundantly bad. It's my opinion the management and cooks must be rich and don't value the fact that feeding 3 people a value meal now costs almost $30 hard earned bucks. They take zero pride in serving fresh food. Most times the food is cold thru the drive thru no matter what you buy and I only live 5 minutes away and by then the food is already ice cold so we almost always just go to the restaurant down the street off Zinfandel. If you want any chance of hot food just dine in. They like to do the old fast food trick of mixing old fries with new fries too. Most times I just go to the other location but we give this one a chance once in awhile since they're closer and unfortunately it's always the same old story. They seem to have a high turnover of staff too, even for a fast food joint, because everytime I've gone thru the drive thru its a different person each time.

Your busy, I get it, great for the company, horrible for the customer. Heres my problem. It doesn't seem like the management pays attention to trends i.e. morning rush, lunch rush, dinner rush. When I spent my time in the industry, that was one of the basic training topics taught early in management courses. That being said, im a little confused. If management receives that training then where is the action? If you know lunch time is coming around, why is there only one cashier working the front counter? If you know people can tend to come before work and or during their first breaks, why are you not better prepared to handle a large crowd of people? I refer back to my ""your busy"" comment to also bring up the fact that the busier you are, the more hours you are allotted from upper management. Sooooo if your busy enough to deserve the hours, use them! Dont skimp on giving ppl hours because you in turn, skimp on customer service. Your smak dab in the middle of one of Rancho Cordova's busiest business districts, schedule accordingly!!

The food is okay, I mean, it's McDonald's, so it's going to taste the same but what got me is the way they operated. For instance, I would go through their drive-thru during lunch and order their chicken nuggets, only to get back to work and realize they forgot the BBQ sauce, meaning, they didn't even ask if I wanted any and I assumed this was just a standard item they would include. I called them once, asking them about this, and they said they don't automatically give BBQ sauce, even if you order chicken nuggets but they automatically include ketchup with fries. Really? So, they automatically ask you if you want ketchup when you order fries but no BBQ sauce for nuggets? That's ridiculous. What's the logic in that?  Also, when I did order their fries, they would never fill them up to the brim. If I order a small, I expect the fries to be filled all the way to the top, not halfway.

It's not like I get a discount when I ask to to hold the mayo! All drinks are the same price but they hand out different sized cups if you ask for a large soda. I asked at the counter why the different sizes and got a shrug for an answer. This place is a constant reminder of why McDonald's is a dying establishment. Come to think of it, why hasn't this place already gone under? For nearly the same price places like In &amp; Out just kills any reason you would have to come here beyond the fact that every other corner seems to have a location.

We saw no one, we continued driving thru and upon arriving at the last window, we saw a man and woman. My boyfriend was able to get the man's attention, he began to approach us. As he was walking toward the drive thru window, he was talking to the woman. We were able to read his lips, we could see he was using profanity. Once he was at the window, we were greeted EXTREMELY rudely. He opened the window and shouted, ""WE'RE CLOSED!"" Waking up our 3 month old daughter. My husband calmly said ""It says you aren't closed until 11pm."" He snapped, ""Our equipment isn't working. We're closed."" At this point I was extremely frustrated. My daughter was now awake (sleeping has been difficult for her since she recently began teething), and we were being treated very poorly by this man.

I enter the drive thru. It is 12:10 PM - prime lunchtime and the drive thru line is 7 cars deep but I am gabbing away with my sister not paying much mind to the fact that I am actually starving entering a McDonald's drive thru and definitely not weighing the potential repercussions. My turn nears so I jump off the phone with Rose, and I pull forward to gaze at the beautiful menu boards.  ""OH SHIT! I am hungry!"" I am an alcoholic entering a bar; a drug addict entering Lindsay Lohan's house; a sex addict on Craigslist casual encounters. My mind says: ""soda only, soda only, soda only. "" My immediate thought is to get French fries too (truly the tastiest item on the McDonald's menu in my opinion), but after years of counting calories I know a medium fry is pushing 400 calories and I just can't do it. I am pushing and pulling in my mind whether or not I should get something, and then I see it: The McRib. It is a novelty, rereleased for a limited time. I missed it the first time around in the early 90's, and loved the parody on the Simpsons when Krusty Burger released the Ribwich and Homer became a Ribhead, traveling around the country following the sandwich like the Dead. I am a poser for loving that episode so much without ever even trying the deliciousness that spiraled Homer down a Requiem for a Dream-like psychedelic wormhole. Hell, NPR even did a fun story on the McRib's rerelease recently, interviewing hip bloggers about how quirky and strange the sandwich is, with its nomadic history and Frankenfood mystique, framing it as almost a piece of Clinton-era pop culture when flannels were cool, SNL was good and Frankenfood had silly, manmade meat-bones, not modified DNA.  ""Order a McRib. Do it for the irony. Do it for the reminiscence. Take a bite of Blossom, 90210 and Saved By the Bell, blended and molded to resemble a rib and drenched in BBQ sauce.""  So I ordered. But apparently I wasn't the only Rancho Cordova McDonald's patron desiring a throw-back sandwich because when I pulled up to acquire my McNostalgia I was informed that the ""ribs ain't ready yet."" So, I pulled forward in the fat of the drive-thru (you know, the turnout area where you wait for them to bring you your food - usually it is for hot fries). I am waiting and I see a man that looks like Mr. McGoo pull in. He is old and despite the fact that his window is rolled up, I can smell 50 years of tobacco in his skin. ""He wants a McRib too, I bet."" I start doubting myself...what am I doing? I hate McDonalds. I am better than this. I can wait for ""real food"" (a term my Health Nut stepmother used to use that would drive me crazy as a child but now makes much more sense to me).  Then, the final straw: a 1994 (no, the irony was not lost) Plymouth Voyager comes hauling ass around the corner like a bat outta hell. The driver and all occupants are fat and fiendish, $1.99 in hand and ready to get at dat rib.  ""I can't do this!""   With the same intensity as that minivan, I burn rubber out of my Drive Thru holding zone, thinking not that I wasted $1.99 but that no food I eat should cost $1.99 anyways...it's like putting AM/PM regular fuel into a Ferrari.  As I am pulling away, I see the female McDonald's employee running to my car holding the small, white, folded bag. She must only assume that I am angry for waiting so long. She holds up the bag, raises her eyebrows and shrugs her shoulders as if to say ""Here it is! Come back! What, you don't want it?""  No, ma'am.

I am writing this review as i feel it is my duty to WARN fellow patrons and the person I am talking to since I filed a complaint (will not disclose the name) is in denial. I visited this McDonald's on Monday, January 9, 2017 and ordered a 20 piece chicken nuggets through the drive-thru. They were cold and tasted like they had been sitting out for quite some time!! I didn't have time to go back as I had to get back to work, so I had just chucked them thinking nothing more of it as being a bad batch and workers being careless. When I went home that night, I was strangely not hungry. Again, thought nothing of it. The next morning I woke up very warm and had a very bad headache. At work, I was having a hard time staying awake and was starting to get chills, achey, and nauseous. My stomach was hurting and I was experiencing bad diarrhea! I had to sleep in my car during my lunch break cuz I was feeling so sick and fatigued and having really bad chills. I did not eating anything else that day due to loss of appetite and nausea. I woke up on Wednesday and felt a little better, but still had headache and diarrhea! Thursday night rolls around and I started to have nothing but bloody stool. I went to the emergency room because of this and I was feeling deathly ill with nausea and vomiting. I was having incontinence as well you know where  I had to be hooked up to an IV and give a stool sample. Mortifying!! The doctor had suspected that I had food poisoning and asked me what I had eaten before I got sick. I told him McDonald's chicken nuggets and on the weekend I didn't have any chicken or meat whatsoever. I told him that those nuggets had tasted very old and like they had been sitting out for a while!! I got the results of my sample back today and I have a bacterial infection called Campylobacter!!!! Commonly found in POULTRY!!!! And likely to have gotten it from the meat that had been sitting out!!! Lo and behold my illness can be traced back to the species I had eaten one day before I started to feel extremely ill!!!! I am writing this to warn people the only way I know how! I do not believe the people I talked to are doing anything to inspect or investigate this location. I have not got an apology, only denial! I have proof I was here on that day and time I said (on my bank statement! Also have a text where I pinpointed my location! I would not be here talking about embarrassing personal things if it was something else!) campylobacter is also a harder bacteria to note for restaurants since it depends on the person, and they usually only occur in isolated events, not outbreaks). I had already had a cold so my immune system was compromised! My stomach is also very sensitive! PLEASE BE WARNED!! And please report if you experience similar symptoms after eating here. I begged corporate to look into this location because I do NOT want other people to get sick how I did. It is misery!!!!! I am still going through it! I lost a whole day of pay from my job because of this!! It is very serious and patrons have a right to know!

I went there yesterday/last night and saw a new ""value meal"" which advertised two Spicy McChickens, and I was thinking WOW.  I definitely wanted to try that, but in my mind I had something similar to Carl's Jr., or Wendy's when I was thinking about a spicy chicken sandwich.    Well if you were thinking tasty spicy chicken sandwich at McDonalds, well you would be mistaken.  It tasted like they literally took chili powder and added some spoon fulls to the breading of their normal McChickens.  Yes it did suck, was not hot or spicy, had very little flavor, had a flavor like sterile dust.  I was regretting it after the first bite and thinking damn I should have got a regular McChicken.    My advice, with this new McDonald's price hike, their competitors should opt into selling $1 drinks and I think McDonald's would see their competitive edge leave.  I still go to McDonald's because it is reasonably cheap, but now about on par with their competitors, except for that $1 drink any size.  Part of me feels like McDondald's is making a political point by inflating the cost of much of their ""Value"" menu.  So i also want to say, yes fast food can pay a living wage and be sustainable, and still charge reasonable prices.  All that said, stay away from their ""Spicy McChicken"" it is neither spice nor delicious.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-rancho-cordova-7?osq=McDonald%27s&start=401341,32,6/24/14,2,They have become very slow.  Waited 35 minutes the other night and I was the third vehicle in line.  I couldn't drive away as the line became congested behind me.

It features two drive up speakers. This McDonald's strikes me as rather average for the chain.

And also its location, makes it nice to frequent the place. Unfortunately, I had an unpleasant exchange of words with the store manager, BEATRIZ (she didn't give us her last name).  I had a prior incident with her at a different McDonalds branch (Laguna blvd, near target) where she gave me an attitude when I complained about a missing milk in my son's happy meal (it happens a lot, they often  mess up orders). Instead of being apologetic, she was so rude and bitchy. She even told me to call the corporate office if I had a problem, so I did. She probably knows that even if you file/call a complaint to the corporate office, nothing will happen. (She was correct!!!), nothing happened and she still works for Mcdonalds with an attitude. Since my son loves going to McDonalds for their toys in the happy meal and the play gym, I tried to ignore this BITCH. But today, at this McDonalds (arco am/pm -Sheldon rd &amp; 99), she's the one that handed me the cup for my drink and told me ""WHY ARE YOU FOLLOWING ME?! (with an attitude).  I am a paying customer, I'm entitled to eat at any McDonalds I want to go to. I don't get my food free. I PAY FOR IT. She even threatened me and my husband that she will ban us from Mcdonalds. REALLY???!!! As if I will loose a lot from not eating at McDonalds (everyone knows its the unhealthiest food on earth! But we do like it). This is a franchise store, so with this kind of employee, the owner will be the one to feel the heat or loose the income. I hope the owner of this franchise will find time to read all the reviews and see how fucked up all his/her employees are.   If I could rate this experience with a negative star, I would...  P.S. And to the store manager, BEATRIZ, please think about your employer. He/She has invested a lot of money into this business, you might only work there for a certain amount of time, but this business is their livelihood. This is the way they make their money, and they keep a lot of other employees there besides you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-elk-grove-11?osq=McDonald%27s&start=201368,33,9/21/16,1,"WARNING:THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN FOUL LANGUAGE  OK so where do I begin with these damn dumbasses??! Every time I go they manage to fuck up my order! In one occasion I ordered a happy meal for my kid and when they gave me the food I specifically asked the girl handing me my food if his apple juice was in the bag and she said yes so I drive off and when I open the bag to give my kid his juice it wasn't there! Not a big deal u might think but when u are running late and rushing to get somewhere u simply don't have time to drive back curse the stupid employees out and get a damn apple juice! The second time I came here I ordered a #9 which obviously it includes the fries and drinks but when I pull up to the window to receive my meal I made sure to open the bag up before I drove off and guess what? My fries where missing!! Wow! Oh and it only gets better! When I asked for my fries it was like if I where asking for the whole fucken menu for free or something! The manager was a dumb bitch asking for my receipt which I automatically throw away so she prints out a new one and shows me that I didn't order fries.. umm hello?? I said a number 9 don't u know that means the whole meal??( Which I didn't understand how they managed to give me my drink and not the fries) so this lady wanted me to pay for my fries which I thought she should just give them to me for free since I waited for 20 minutes but I'm not that type of person trying to get a free meal out of McDonald's so I said yes I'll pay the difference to make it a meal so she want to charge me $3 more which was stupid because I had pay $6 dollars already for the burger and drink! So I said no honey I'm not about to pay $9 for a meal. So since they apparently don't have a braid I did the math for her and told her I only had to pay $1 and some change which I did and they gave me the fries. I was just in shocked that they had me go through all that bullshit just for some crappy fries and still had the audacity to charge me! Uugghhh!! And the third third time I went which was my last time I ordered my kid 2 beef patties with cheese because he doesn't eat the bread just the meat (he's a toddler) these geniuses packed the meat upside down which made the cheese stick to the cardboard box and left with nasty ass patty without the cheese, it was basically a cardboard cheese burger! Omg!! They irritate my soul! I seriously don't know why I keep going!

Another few minutes roll by and I start seeing the cars behind me pile up. Finally, she comes back with the food, and nicely says to have a nice night. I roll forward, stop and count the bags for accuracy like I always do and then drive home. However, when I got home, after opening the Grand Mac boxes, we were incredibly disappointed to find all of the buns were hard as rocks, stale and inedible. We ended up only being able to eat the meat patties. It was truly gross and disappointing. The buns on the couple McDoubles we had also ordered were the same way.

One Erin Carr-Jordan, ""a mother of four and an Arizona State University instructor with a Ph.D. in developmental psychology,"" has been documenting unsanitary conditions in the play structures nationwide with videos and swabs for bacteria. She started a ""Kids Play Safe"" web site to establish more regulations ""so that no more children are unnecessarily endangered."" Meanwhile, the owner of 8 Golden Arches in Arizona has prohibited her from entering his restaurants.  As Kara B. wrote, the 7527 Laguna location has a ""garish-cheesy-kid-McHeaven"" that is ""separated by a wall of handy dandy soundproof glass"" from the ""adult"" dining area.  The children's room has a high ceiling and can seat about 50 people. Although overall the room is well-maintained, the upholstery in the booths is worn, so that some stuffing is coming out of the seats. I agree that the hard floor, walls, and ceiling causes any ""ear-piercing McScreaming"" to bounce around the room, especially as kids chase after each other in circles around the ""McPlaystructure.""  The play structure has an about-20-foot-tall climbing area for 3-12 year olds and a toddler area on the ground for children 3 or under. As for whether it is as free of germs as possible, it has looked clean to me on numerous occasions, but of course a single Peanuts ""Pig-Pen"" type child could change that situation in a minute.

However, the drive thru ""can never mix drinks"". I talked to corporate and they mentioned that, ""owners have 90% rights to configure their policy however they see fit."" However, the MCD's Corporation and this GREEDY OPPORTUNIST owner FAILS TO SEE that they will be reviewed as both not ADA COMPLIANT nor DISABLED VETERANS COMPLIANT as well in a state like CA where it takes ANY FORM OF DISCRIMINATION VERY SERIOUSLY!

Normally I wouldn't do one of these for a fast food place because who does these things for fast food places? Yeah, apparently me...  So let good ol' Gucci Mage tell you a story  Today I came here after a meeting. Usually I would go to another place to eat but it was closed because it was too early in the morning. So, I decided to go to McDonald's to sit down and have a bite to eat. There was only one person at the register when there was a line, and come to find out later on he was new. I sat for about 13 minutes waiting for my food. I was getting frustrated because they were calling numbers that were above mine, 289. ""288 is ready!.... 290 is ready!... 291 is ready... 292 is ready..."" and finally! ""289 is ready!""  I go up to the counter where I assume this Indian lady is the manager who called out my number. I show her my receipt and with a snarky attitude tells me ""I called your number but I said it wasn't ready."" What!? I was never told it wasn't ready. You called my number so it should be ready... So I'm standing at the counter for another 5 minutes waiting for my food. She then realizes my tray was already put together sitting right beside her. She just shoves me my food without even apologizing for the inconvenience.   Oh it doesn't end there. My orange juice wasn't ready. The guy pushes two oranges juices towards me and I grab one and then try to grab the other. He pulls it away from me and tells me to wait as he looks at his screen... FOR WHAT!!?? I ordered two meals one for me and another for my partner! about another minute goes by before he realizes that the other orange juice is mine. Lastly, the thing that irked me the most is she took that cashier during a lull, sat him down at a table and proceeded to scold him about his performance in front of customers. That is the biggest no-nos of all no-nos. I don't blame that cashier I blame the manager and ""only"" the manager for her decisions.

Very odd and under positive influences I wouldn't have made mention of this anomaly yet when crapped on with her deplorable customer service and a disgustingly smug attitude served as a side dish I notice that I will then tend to focus on a humans undesirable traits which match their less then savory disposition and character verses overlooking cosmetic traits and appreciating the inner beauty of a soul.

No ""how may I help you"" ""thank you"" or ""good bye"".  And she clung to the small amount of ketchup packets we requested for our in store to-go order as if they were the last ketchup packets on the entire planet and as if she had made them herself. pfffffff...  Número Uno hide chapping event on both trips to this subpar McDonalds is that they charge for condiments such as mayo packets which is how I eat my double cheeseburgers and McDoubles; I chuck all the buns except maybe one and drown the fatty cheesy meat-like-burgery goodness in a mixture of ketchup and mayo.  Not on this trip as this ""Manager"" informed us she'd be charging us .25 EACH packet.  Needless to say I choked down my dry burgers sans the mayo but it's the principle of the matter.  Cheap cheap and cheap.  Lastly this location should take some of their proceeds and repair and maintain their outdoor lighting as on our maiden voyage here we drOve clean past this dive as the Golden Arches as well as electronic signs were either completely turned off, not working or only partially in order making it impossible to spot them.

This store replaces the older nearby location that was on the southeast corner of Madison and Sunrise.  I dropped by mainly to use the wi-fi and get some work done as I often do in the evenings. The nearly brand new building was nice and clean as expected and showcased some of the latest McD's technology, such as a self-service order kiosk out front and spiffy Dyson ""blade"" air hand dryers in the bathrooms. The wi-fi was flawless as well... no doubt benefiting from being planned rather than retrofitted into the building.  I couldn't resist giving the order kiosk a try.

Needing to do some shopping I decided to try out the McDonald's that opened last month. Good looking parking lot with plenty of space. Duel land drive thru, nice.  I walk in, it's pretty clean. Just 1 or 2 tables people just left that have crumbs on it. The look it pretty snazzy with a huge make line open for all customers to see the action.  The menu boards are giant tvs. Kind of annoying how quick the board changes from the menu to an add for McDonald's breakfast or a video showing a single patty cooking on a flat top grill. The young blonde cashier is very nice. So far this is looking like the best McDonald's ever.  But if it was, I wouldn't of rated it 1 star lol. I place my order and get my lid and straw for my soda. I grab some napkins from the dispenser that is trying not to share. After pretty much having to hold the napkin dispenser up at gun point, I manage to get like 5 napkins. When I go to grab some ketchup, well the ketchup holder is empty. It's okay I got ranch and bbq coming with my order. I sit at one of the tables, and hot damn if the table doesn't have outlets all along the side of it. I figure that's got to be nice for the business customer with a laptop. My food arrives. Double quarter pounder, small fries, and a 20 piece chicken mcnuggets. And now the start of going downhill like a semi with no breaks. The fries are life support warm. I am talking about below room temperature, but not yet cold as in the artic. Damn, McDonald's fries when not hot and fresh are like the 4th of July with one smoke bomb instead of a fireworks display. I put them off to the side. Time to dig into the double quarter pounder. What's this? The meat is cold also. So that's why the 2 pieces of cheese on it are not even melted. As I work the cold bite in my mouth I look up just in time to see the menu board mocking me by playing the video of a single patty all hot and cooking on a flat top grill. Damn you McDonald's video board. After finishing the new McDonald's artic meat double quarter pounder, I open my mcnuggets. Wow, now these are still hot. Holy cow they do know what heat is. To bad it's only for nuggets.  Now at this time the table of 3 next to me get their food. Wait for it...... It's COLD also. They take it back up to the front and ask for hot food. So I guess I missed the sign upon entering that stated you must request your cooked food hot, or you get the swimming pool warm temp. Noted. At this point I am already thinking what score to give them on yelp, figuring about 2 stars because the cashier was super nice to everyone, when my eye catches a person entering the make line.  Somehow I feel and know I am not going to be happy. The lady is probably late 30s early 40s. She is timing her apron strings together on her back.  All I can think is please wash your hans, please wash your hands. No luck. She then scratches her elbows while chatting a manager up. Okay so far it's not all that bad, just wash your hands before touching food.  Now she brings her hands to her face while laughing and touches her lips. Oh no, who knows where those lips have been and for how long.  In my head I am screaming NO. To no avail. An order comes in. With her hands she is grabbing buns and making burgers. Wait she needs to use her hands to push her hair in the back up into her cap. Now back to fondling those burger buns with unclean hands so people can taste and ingest everything you have touched. Guess she believes sharing is caring. The other two crew members on the make line are using gloves, but not our Lady. Nope, no glove so she can share the love.

Pull up to the window, and the girl is somewhat prompt after she finished whatever she was doing, texting? Not friendly. Moved on to get my simple order, and I see frick and frack, two men, back there playing around, laughing , tapping each other? Both are in dark shirts, oddly supposed to indicate some kind of quasi management? Really? I wait an inordinate time for them to hand me the bag of mine sitting by the window. Many times frick and frack pass by the window, sometimes glancing my way. Finally Frack, the larger of the two, says just a muffin? WHILE THE WINDOW IS CLOSED. He then opens the window, and hands me the bag. I sit, and he says anything else? YES, my order. He then hands me my soda. NO hello, no good bye, no thank you, no enjoy your COLD mcmuffin, or gross diet coke, nothing, just back to playing slap ass with Frick. Get a room.   The most egregious concern of this place is the price gouging. I ordered a sausage biscuit another time which is like $1.19 or $1.29, I then add cheese, and it goes to $1.99. I ask the twit at the cash register why, and she said I added cheese. I said how much is cheese, she and the genius supervisor decide cheese is .40 extra, so I ask why is it now $1.99? Neither can answer, but that is the price with cheese. Uhm NO I tell the supervisor, I want the money refunded from the price it should be. She then tells the twit to give me my change back. The twit does and proceeds to tell me this will be the only time this happens, next time the charge will be $1.99 I laughed and told her, yeah that will never happen,   Someone needs to review all of their charges.

Being that as it may, I still can't in good conscience even give this restaurant even two stars.  The fact of the matter is that it happens to be in an oasis of neat places in a neighborhood that's crap. Hong Kong House, a surprisingly good Chinese eatery on one side of it and Ninja Sushi on the other would make one think that this McDonald's might step up their game and be part of the businesses that are legitimately working to make the area relatively classy. If you think that - you'd be dead wrong.  This is, without any doubt in my mind, the absolute worst managed fast food hellhole I've ever been to. Before you even walk through the door, you'll have to pass by the at least 5 homeless people sitting or standing there yelling obscenities at each other. Guaranteed. To. Be. There.  If you manage to make it to the door without being stabbed, you'll find that your hands will immediately start slapping at the air to ward of the multitude of flies that seem to have taken up residence there. Like they pay rent or some shit. Then you'll notice a few of those homeless guys like the one outside are sitting in the booth by the front door. Ain't doing shit but sitting there.

THE ISSUE  Of course McDonald's menu fare has become so standardized that I am guessing there is no ""surprise"" that much anymore as to what you would expect.  Their McDoubles, their shakes, their Angus burgers, and their fries are all very standard for consumers.  So most review issues these days have to do with customer service, cleanliness of the establishment, and perhaps preparation snafus.  This evening after finishing my power walk by 8pm, I happened by my neighborhood McDonald's which doesn't close it's doors to the restaurant portion until 9pm.  The drive-thru then stays open until 1am.  However, as I was happening upon the restaurant, I noticed some ""commotion"" amongst would-be patrons that were stuck outside the front door.  Of course, I was interested in what was going on, especially the fact that the restaurant was kicking people out and not letting anyone in.  Was there a fight?  Did someone get hurt?  Did someone have a heart attack?  Why so much commotion?  No.  It wasn't anything exciting like that.  What happened is apparently they go into a ""lock-out"" mode when their staffing falls to 3-4 people or fewer.  And then they don't service people in the restaurant anymore.  They only do the drive-through customers.  I find this terribly unfortunate and ironic because I want to know, ""When did the drive-through ""drive"" the business plan for McDonald's?""  The problem as it manifests itself is that there are several apartment complexes near my condo-complex where a lot of families I recognize come and socialize, congregate and buy their dinners there.  [I won't enter in this review into a discussion on the merits or cons of a McDonald's meal - I accept the fact that it is a restaurant establishment like any other and it's up to people to monitor their own intake of particular kinds of fast food - so this is not a lecture to that end.]  However, this is where employees (and their management) lose sight of the BIGGER ISSUES that their decisions are trampling upon.  The McDonald's employee told everyone to get in their cars and go through the drive-through.  Okay.  Here's a problem as one of the fathers of one of the Latino families present stated, ""We don't have a car and we just walked a half mile here to grab dinner.""  The nonplussed employee said very unsympathetically, ""That's not my problem.  Go get a friend's car then.""  I couldn't believe what I was hearing.  What an ass-hat.  Worse in my mind, is the fact that one of the African-American gentlemen, who had already been inside, paid for his products, and then rushed out when everyone was told to leave, responded civilly, ""Hey, I wanted to get my soda refill before you threw us out.""  The McDonald's employee said, ""Tough.""  This is merely just one example where a lack of training of employees in customer service skills and priorities, and a diminishing ethos in corporate culture that instead chooses to thumb it's nose at the very people they should be respecting, demonstrates why this country is LOSING on all of it's cultural fronts.  We saw it from companies like Lehman Brothers selling toxic mortgage securities on Wall Street, precipitating the worst recession that we are still in.  We saw the graft and greed of Haliburton and Enron bleeding both our defense industry or their own employees into financial ruin.  And now, we see the ""little people"" getting dumped on who just want to grab a $1 burger but are told they need to have a car in order to do it.  And it was particularly poignant seeing the look of terrible terrible disappointment on one of the little girl's faces when she was told by her mamasita that she was NOT going to be able to get her ""happy meal"" for being a good girl all weekend.

They treat their customers like shit.  On February 28th around 7:30pm, I went to the drive through and ordered a mcflurry. After I placed my order, I asked if I could place a second order for the second person in my car. The employee running the drive through said ""uh no, we're a little busy right now."" My passenger said ""So you won't take my order?"" The employee said ""Uhhh depends how big the order will be."" My passenger said ""Even for just a McFlurry?!"" The employee said : ""Well that I might be able to do.It's just one mcflurry."" My passenger then attempted to order a butterfinger mcflurry, but they employee said they were out! Out of a basic mcflurry flavor? Really? They weren't even busy that night at all, but I still had to wait over 8 minutes for my mcflurry. The drive through guy's utter lack of professionalism was completely unacceptable, as was the wait time.  I submitted a complaint online and after corporate told the store about my complaint, a manger from the store called once but did not leave a voicemail. I knew it was that location because I googled the number. When I called back, the manager who answered did not even apologize and literally said ""Well what do you want me to do about it?"" As a manager, she should know what to do about it. McDonalds should be thoroughly embarrassed to have a manager who doesn't know or care enough to make customers happy. Furthermore, she defended the employee and said ""well when we're busy we don't take more than two orders from the drive through."" 1. I was only trying to place two orders. 2. That's complete bullshit. She was also very unprofessional with lots of ""uhhhhhs"" and clear disinterest in my complaint.  Another example, another time I went to this same location I ordered an iced coffee and specifically said ""black, no sugar, no cream."" A different manager gave me a cup with 90% milk and 10% coffee. When I complained, he argued with me, saying that black coffee would be too strong for me and asking me repeatedly if I was sure. I'm an adult--I know how I like my damn coffee. When I insisted he give me what I actually ordered, he said they were out of coffee. I had to wait 20+ minutes to get my coffee.

The meat, if you could call it that, is thin and tastes nothing like beef. The Big Mac must be one of the most poorly conceived hamburgers. The extra bun is wholly unnecessary, the special sauce is excessively flavored with mayonnaise and the lettuce comes in a thin cut that can be found at no other eateries.  Not all in the family agree with me.  A couple weeks ago, my step dad claimed the Big Mac remained a good hamburger. He brought up the topic as a sort of pitch to convince us. ""They're actually good,"" he said in what seemed to be a mix of his own surprise. The two of us drove to this McDonald's to order three Big Macs. He wanted his without onions. We wanted nothing else special for the order.  Now, drive-thru technology has made it so we don't know whether drive-thru attendants are idiots or if the headset/speaker combination is malfunctioning. I've tried to counter this by ordering in what can be best described as a Washington accent. I speak a little slower and attempt to clearly annunciate my vowels. ""Three Big Macs. One without onions."" First attempt. No luck. A ""huh?"" came through the speaker and my step dad was audibly shocked. Even he could tell I altered my voice to make it easy for the women on the end of the line. I repeated my order. Of course, they didn't get the order right. Onions were left off all three hamburgers. I shouldn't have expected much.  All is not lost. The chicken nuggets and chicken selects are solid, even if they seem like they are made from entirely different foul. The French fries remain good. The salads were a good addition to the menu. (It's puzzling McDonald's doesn't think to use the salad lettuce with the hamburgers. It's as if they partition the quality vegetables away from the dunce cap, hamburger vegetables.).  This drive-thru story stuck out to me.

I've never had fries come out better than lukewarm, and they're always covered in too much salt if you don't order them without it. Their Chicken Selects, back when they first had them, came out practically burnt. Their soda machine consistently produces soda that's either flat from a lack of carbonation or watered down from not having enough syrup. It once took them TEN MINUTES to make two McDoubles when there was LITERALLY nobody else in the drive-thru or in the restaurant. It's one of the filthiest McDonald's out there; even ones in the worse parts of Sacramento tend to be cleaner. And tonight was the final straw - I ordered a 20-piece Chicken McNugget, a large fry, and a large milkshake. The order should've come out to around $10, but the cashier, looking to make HER job easier, rang it up as a combo which normally comes with 20 nuggets, 2 large fries and 2 large sodas, which on its own is ten bucks. So what should've been a $10 order came out closer to $15 because I was charged for a combo I didn't order, which would've been bad enough, except I didn't even get the extra stuff that combo comes with (the second large fry and the two sodas). I got charged MORE money so the CASHIER'S job would be easier.   Again, I don't expect much when I go to McDonald's, but this is absurd; I don't know of any other McDonald's in Sacramento where the service is this bad, and I've been to some really terrible ones.

The drive-thru is ridiculously slow. They don't know how to approach people. I went there several times before, but I think this time was the worst. Don't say I didn't try to give them a better review. First of all... All we ordered was one soda, and two coffees. How long does it take them to make some coffee? Not only that but they screwed up my order too?!   You got two windows. One's a cashier and the other is where you pick up your order. The cashier should stay put and take orders like she is supposed to. You have a problem at the pick up because of a wrong order, FIX IT THERE! Swear like you don't have a system available to use. The girl left us at the speaker mic for at least 10 minutes because the so called manager could not resolve the issue. If I was an employee at a fast food restaurant, which I have no shame, I was before, I'd make the damn customer satisfied like customer service should be and get them to pull over so that we can resolve the issue.  And when we pull up to the window, don't act like you're better than everyone talking with an attitude. Um, last I checked, McDonald's does not pay you to act like a b/tch. I'm just saying. If you don't like your job BOUNCE, be a broke b/tch. Ain't nobody give a damn. Not only that, this is optional, but I betchu it would satisfy your customers more than you're lack of communication with us. If you're lines are ridiculously slow, like 20 minutes and your drive-thru is packed with angry customers, COMPENSATE THEM WITH A CHEESEBURGER or SOMETHING. You don't want people yelling at you through the window, do something that would make them happy.   Sigh. Worst customer service ever. They need to replace their staff and their supervisor/manager whatever he wants to be. How much can you lack from much customer service skill that would still make you a manager? Pathetic.

Odds are, they got something wrong. My favorite is when they say the chicken strips will take x amount of minutes, and ask you to drive around to the front doors and wait--they claim they will bring your order out to you. Then they never bring it out, and you have to go in get it.

It's a 50/50 chance with any McDonald's location so choose wisely.   Service:   This location always seems to have ten employees working in the back; however, it's still one the slowest locations around despite all those workers. I will say that I've always been greeted with a smile (mostly by the women) here so that's a plus. I would also say to expect to wait a little longer at this location when it comes to actually ordering your food because there always seem to be some 'technical' issue. I waited an extra 5 minutes because the cash register (computer/card reader) reset and no one knew how to fix it, so they only took cash. I totally lucked out that I was paying for cash that day or I would have wasted almost 15 minutes off my 30 minute lunch just standing around in a McDonald's. That's not very cool.  Amenities:  This location has free WiFi so that's a major plus if you are a student or working professional who always has to stay connected. I can actually still check work emails and Facebook updates w/o burning through my data plan and enjoy music (the music here isn't bad at all). I always see people with their laptops working and ""chilling"" (coffee shop vibe-at a MCD's) which makes me feel comfortable to just sit back relax and enjoy my meal before heading back to the office. There is also a cool playground for kids to play while parents enjoy some good conversation with friends (still keeping on eye on their children) or taking a quick breather before heading back out on the road.   Overall, I don't think this is a bad McDonald's location at all. It has its pros and cons like all McDonalds do but it has the potential to be even better. Will I come back? Of course I will!

However, the Playplace as a whole leaves a lot to be desired.  The day we visited, the automatic sliding door wasn't functioning.  Kids would either try to slide the door closed, or would run through the open door into the ""adult"" dining area.  Neither is very safe. Perhaps the situation is temporary, although if the door is fixed I'm thinking that kids would then play with it by making it open/close automatically.  Also, a lot of trash accumulated on the tables and ground that people should have tossed into the garbage cans, and no McD's worker came by to clean the place in the 30 minutes we were there.  Most importantly, the 24 metal revolving chairs fixed to the ground are dangerous.  See uploaded photo.  The chairs have no stops to limit the amount of swiveling to, say, 90 degrees.  Therefore, a small child can easily smash his/her finger between a chair and an unmovable table, which is exactly what happened with our kid.  The potential for injury is unacceptable.  If you go to the Playplace with an active toddler, sit in the booths and make sure the little ones stay away from the rotating seats.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-carmichael?osq=McDonald%27s&start=202025,46,12/29/12,2,"Being in an on the go family, sometimes when we are out doing our shopping the fastest place to go to is McDonalds to get a bite to eat.

When it was time to place my order, I smiled hello to the woman working the register.  She did not smile back.  I asked if there were any nugget portions other than 20 piece that could be ordered, as I did not see any others on the menu, and she said that they sold a 10 piece.  I said that I would like to order a 10 piece.   So she rang it in and it came to $4.09.  Since I could basically double my order for $0.90, I figured that I could at least treat my dog to a chicken nugget meal for $0.90, so I immediately apologized and told the cashier that, on second though, I'll stick with a 20 piece.  She rolled her eyes at me.    I appreciated that she rolled her eyes at me.  It was a fair reaction.  After all, she carried the enormous burden of pushing two additional buttons as a result of my unforgivable recklessness, and since she has a 9th grade ""streets smart"" education courtesy of the Mexico City public school system, whereas I wasted my time in graduate school earning my Doctorate, I am the stupid one for not meeting her expectations as a customer.    In fairness, I do not know her actual level of education; for all I know, it is entirely possible that she earned her GED while in prison.  It is really not an issue either way, so I do not intend to distract from the message with that discussion.  I provided exact change.  This also appeared to bother her by the annoyed deep breath of frustration that she took when I paid, but I could be mistaken since her emotions were somewhat masked by the fact that she had no eyebrows except those that were tattooed or drawn onto her face.  I say ""tattooed or drawn"" because at this point I was more concerned about what they were doing to my food than adding details to the list of visible defects on this woman who's life clearly took a tragic turn at some point early on.

So.....frustrated, I went back.  Talked to the manager (didn't get his name).  Explained the sitch and he apologized.  I was frustrated so I also explained that my family was eating dinner without me, that I've consistently had problems with McD's goofing my order, that In N' Out was the only fast food joint that had NEVER goofed my order (his response was, ""Yeah, In N' Out's really good""), and then I asked if I could have a fresh patty (rather than a gray one) to go with my burger....said he'd take care of it.  I sat back and watched them make my burger.  I watched a lady take a patty out of a drawer so I asked the manager about it.  He explained they make the patty's every two or three minutes.  I told him I understood, but would really like a fresh one.  Again, said he'd take care of it.  He went back, made a burger and I watched him put onions and two slices of cheese on it!!!!  Really??!  He apologized again, said he had ""spaced it"" and went back to make a new, fourth burger!

I've had mixed experiences here. The food is your typical McDonald's food, nothing spectacular but they're fairly consistently average. (No soggy fries, mushy hamburger buns, etc.) The interesting thing that is they now started charging for things like extra pickles, or extra anything at both South Lake Tahoe locations.   It's sort of like how most fast food chains charge you for cheese, regardless of whether or not you get it on your burger. After getting nickled and dimed, if I choose to get a burger without cheese, I'll ask for it on the side. Makes a good treat for my dogs, otherwise it the cheese can feed the trashcan. Why? Because I PAID for it. (Okay, fine, that's a little immature. :) )  A number of times they've made mistakes, like neglect include the drink cup for a combo I've ordered. I normally phrase my statements to avoid laying blame, so I said, ""Hi, excuse me, can I get a cup for the combo meal? I didn't get one yet."" and the employee gave me the dirtiest look and slammed the cup down on the counter. (Actually, I think it was the manager who made the mistake and copped unwarranted attitude.)  It's not like I went up there and said, ""Hey, you ugly incompetent b**ch. You effin' forgot my G. d*mn cup!"" though perhaps that would have been more appropriate. I guess the imposition of correcting their own mistakes is so horrible they gotta act that way.

What can I say.  After 6 hours of hiking, eating a value meal and the cone did little to perturb my healthier eating habits.  I think of it as already being burned ;)  Good staff and the food was hot.  Nicer that it is located right before you get out of S.

My wife lately has asked for the two cheeseburger combo.  We always ask for it with no ketchup, no mustard, and no onion, and yet every time we place the order, it's as if we don't speak the same language...something else common in Merced.  Two weeks ago, they screwed up the order by putting an entirely different type of sauce on them.  Last week, they completely failed to put ANYTHING on the cheeseburgers, including the cheese...to say nothing of the fact that while I was stopped at one of the two order boxes awaiting their oh-so-wonderful customer service earlier that same day, FOUR cars went through the other order box before anyone even thought to ask to take our order.  Needless to say, we left rather mad and without ordering until later in the afternoon on this trip.  Today, more of the same...instead of them holding the ketchup, mustard and onions and giving us the two cheeseburgers with meat, cheese and pickles, they left the ketchup and held the pickles.

I tried to scout for any errors like no hand washing and didn't notice any violations because they seem to have people taking control of certain jobs to maintain order and work flow, something that seem to be practice and very efficient here at this location. The only thing that I did see is velcro tape up high that was not removed making it look like somebody is lazy to remove a simple tape off tiles, but it is really up high so Maintenance needs to give them a visit. Their two employees filling drinks seem to memorize every order coming because they know what drink goes with what order even when you have 13 drinks in front of you.

I promised two teens that I'd take them to an IMAX movie if their grades were at least a 3.5 GPA at Christmas and I took them to San Jose to see two shows.  On the way back, they asked --pleaded-- for me to stop at McDonald's as they were STARVING and though I begged them to consider a sit-down restaurant that has real hamburgers, real chicken, and real milkshakes, they insisted on McDonald's so I offered them a wager:  try the milkshake at my restaurant, then we'll go to McDonald's and have theirs; if they like my restaurant of choice's milkshakes better than McD's, they have to weed my front yard's plant beds; if they liked McDonald's milkshakes better, I have to buy their lunch.  These two kids were starved so they agreed: their mom sat back and just smiled (she's been trying to wean them off crappy food before they go off to college).  We stopped at my restaurant: they sat down and had a REAL shake, then drove to McDonald's and they tried the theirs.  No contest here.

At first when I had a problem, I just thought it was due to inexperienced staff since it was fairly new. But over time I have had several problems with the service provided by this McDonald's. First time I had went inside and did the order at the counter, and when I left  McDonald's I noticed they did not put my two cheeseburgers in the bag, so I then had to comeback to get them. Then another time it was also not a good experience, I ordered a shamrock shake at drive thru and when I got to the order pickup, they told me it was not ready, and they told me to go park and someone would come out with the shake, no one did, It was nearly 10 minutes for one shake, I had to go in and get it my self. Another bad time, was when I ordered inside and was waiting for about 15 minutes and noticed every one behind me was getting their orders, and I saw two bags on the counter but I was not sure they were mine, and it gets worse that no one called the number and then some other customer actually had the nerve to look inside my order, so then the employee gave a rude response and she said yes I called it,and I said no you did not I was right here, so then I told them to give new fries since some guy actually stuck his hand in my bag. The employees are so rude and not friendly I would highly not recommend this McDonald's. I have saved the worst problem for last, at drive thru I ordered a chicken bacon club sandwich and then took it home,I was shocked when I opened the box, I noticed that they had given me a chicken sandwich, with no chicken patty. This was so lame and pathetic, I was very annoyed the only thing it had on the bun was tomato and bacon. So then I had to go back again and show them this pathetic attempt to make a chicken sandwich.  Then I got a call from the manager of the McDonald's and he did not even offer me a free sandwich after I had to go back and spend more money on gas to fix this pathetic problem. I personally believe they need to higher new workers that are friendly and can make your order without a mistake. If I could have given this McDonald's a no star review I would have.  Heather W is absolutely correct worst McDonald's ever. Now every time I order inside and drive thru I always open to make sure it looks okay.

Yesterday my total was $19.28. I gave the first window cashier $20.28 and she enters that I gave her $20.26. I argued back telling her I gave her $20.28 and i was supposed to get back a dollar bill. After she argued back with me she realized she was wrong. Ok, so I move on to the next window and get my food. I'm about to make a U turn at the stop light and notice my 2 fries are not in the bag. I drove back to the drive thru not even stopping by the first cashier window and went straight to the second window. Im pissed and ask for the manager!! I told her that this happens all the time when i go thru the drive thru. All she did was turn around and told the employee that originally gave me my food to get the fries missing and to give them to me. That was it. No sorry or anything!!!

The customer service is even worse. Every once in a while there is one person who is nice and doesn't act like you are bothering them. One time I went thru the drive thru and ordered a 20 piece nugget and I looked in the bag and asked the guy if both 20 pieces were in there and he told me yeah so stupid me, I left. Sure enough I got home and there was only 10 in the bag. This is when I went to call (several times) and no one answered. So I ended up going back. When I did I told the girl my issue and she acted like I was bothering her (forgive me). Then I stood there for about 10 min while she helped other people. Finally I got my nuggets.

Already being in traffic for a couple hours, we just needed something quick. Quick became 30+ minutes.  We ordered the new and improved quarter pounder with cheese, 20 nuggets, large fries, and a large sweet tea.  This location has nothing outside for customers to get. No straws. No napkins. Not even ketchup. When you ask for your cup, they'll hand you a cup and a straw. If you dine in, they'll bring your order to the table. It seriously takes more than 10 minutes to get your order. You'll also have to ask for ketchup and napkins too.  The sweet tea was empty, so someone else asked them to refill it. 10 minutes go by and no one did anything. At that point, it was time to hand the cup to the cashier and tell him to get it in the back.  We weren't the only ones.

Let's start with location.  It is situated on the corner of a major intersection. Pretty good spot if you ask me.  It always seems to be busy and there's never a dull moment at the location.  However, there are a LOT of teenagers that hang out there for no apparent reason.  Well, I'm sure the reason is that there's nowhere else to hang out so they go there instead.  The teens tend to take up a lot of table space even though they don't order anything.  Management doesn't seem to care much and let them do it.  It's not exactly ideal for your little ones since they're walking around from one table to another.  I literally had to get in between my kids and the teens in order to prevent them from running to my kids.  But luckily, most will not go into the kiddie area, and have some respect for the children's play area.  I tend to eat my food there when my kids are present.  The play structure seems to feel ""greasy"" all the time.  Not quite sure if they wipe it down or not but from what my kids tell me, the upper portion of the play structure ""smells bad"".  Apparently, its not ventilated enough up there.  My kids still have fun there, but the ambiance of it all just isn't for the adults.    The drive-thru is one of the worst that I have experienced.  They always forget something in the bag or give you a wrong order, straws but no napkins, napkins but no straws....its on-going.  It's not often that I eat at fat food joints but if i had to eat at a McDonald's, I'll drive 6 miles north to Wesley to eat there instead.  Sure, that one is more of a trucker stop McDonald's but they actually do care about your order.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-patterson-2?osq=McDonald%27s&start=203015,64,5/12/15,2,"I ordered a double cheese burger,  got a single burger with 2 slices of cheese. ..  smh",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-patterson-2?osq=McDonald%27s&start=203016,64,1/11/15,2,"I dont usually go to a mcdonalds anymore because i got tired of it, but yesterday i wanted an iced coffee before heading to work.

She stated the driver would now have to wait 20 minutes for the order which is completely out of line since she didn't seem to understand someone else had canceled it first which means a whole separate driver comes. 2nd instance same ""manager"" is now completely ignoring the fact that the uber driver was there since I guess she now doesn't like him.

Bad customer service values and sloppy dining room is what i encountered. I placed my order and was handed a cup. I walked over to the soda fountain and the whole floor was sticky. Really sticky like bubble gum to the bottom of my shoe sticky. Loud peeling noises as i lifted my shoe off the tile. Yes, that sticky. And the whole area in front of the drink area was like that. So, i put my cup under the nozzle, and no nozzle is present. Carbonated water flying everywhere. All over me, all over counter. I ask the manager to please put in the nozzles. So the restaurant is open but the floor is totally sticky and  the drink nozzles are not present. I don't think they are ready for business here. So im handed my bag of food upon notifying the manager of the nozzle situation. I head back into the sticky zone to get my drink and notice that their are no napkins in my bag. So i fill my drink and head over to the front counter to ask the manager for some napkins on the way out. She informs me that there are napkins back over by the soda fountain. I inform here that im done walking into the sticky stuff. SHE MAKES A FACE, HER SHOULDERS DROP, and without taking one step, turns halfway around and picks up some napkins BEHIND HER, and gives them to me.  Poor effort.

The hours posted on Google and Yelp (at the time at least) were inaccurate and in reality the store was open, but for Drive Thru orders only.  After walking up and seeing this, I approached the Drive Thru windows, hands up, to be clear I wasn't looking for trouble. I made myself visible from more than 30 or so feet away and caught the attention of an employee who waived and walked away without opening the window. This happened a second time with a different employee. Finally, on the third attempt to get someone's attention, they opened the window to tell me they would not serve me, they gave no explanation as to why, and they slammed the window shut.  It was frustrating having walked there for nothing, but I assume the policy exists for employee safety, and I didn't intend to argue it.  A day or two later I came into the restaurant with my children and a friend. I mentioned to the Manager taking my order how I'd been frustrated with the refusal of service. He made no apologies and offered no thanks for my patronage. He said they don't serve walk ups as they're always ""homeless or drunk and never up to any good.""  Not sure if I looked homeless or intoxicated, and I didn't take it personally, but he was rude and it was embarrassing with my friend and kids there.  We got our meal quickly but my friend brought his back, as it was someone else's order. We then waited more than 15 minutes for him to receive an incomplete version of his actual order. 0-2. We got no apologies and ten minutes later when following up, the Manager offered him a partial refund as he didn't know when my friend's order would be ready. Still no apology, and all the while he was short and rude.  I've had several interactions with staff here and seen no attempt at warmth or customer support worthy of retention.

The sausage muffin with egg is always nicely made, juicy meat, perfectly cooked egg and the bun is crispy browned lightly on the edges but still soft and fresh, never chewy or stale. Some like muffins toasted black on the edges, I like that once in a while too, ...the Wallerga McDs near Elkhorn blvd always makes them like that, hard black edges, but their muffins are sometimes stale. Blue Oaks is consistent on the sausage burritos too, they are never undercooked or cold, and the burrs are always nicely filled, some McDs have under-filled ones. Another winner is the best big breakfast, I never get hotcakes, but the big breakfast is always generous with the scrambled eggs, the sausage is always juicy and fresh tasting and the hash browns are browned well to make them crunchy. The muffins are toasted well and browned lightly just like with the sausage muffins sandwiches. Not done yet, ...Their regular coffee is the best maybe of any McDs I've been to. It's still fast food level coffee but still hardy and full tasting. Their cafe style coffees aren't bad but not as good as Starbucks and almost as expensive.

Let me tell you.  I use to visit this location very often. Actually I probably spent an average of 60.00-80.00 dollars a week here until I just could not stand the poor customer service anymore. Let me explain.  I typically like to buy a 20 Chicken nuggets along with a burger or fries or a drink for myself. Typically my bill would be about 10.00 on up depending on if I was buying just for me or others.   The Elkhorn Mc D's generally is good, well average. I've had better and I've had worse. The problem I constantly have though is a simple request. That request is that I get 4 packs of sauce typically sweet and sour with my order instead of the 3 they want to give you to save costs for a 20 piece order. Now everyone knows  packet of sauce lasts for about 5 nuggets. So why Mc D's tries to cut costs and give only three packs is just wrong, it's bad customer service. But I understand cutting costs.   However what I don't understand is why even after asking for that extra packet, sometimes even being charged extra for it! Even though Mc D's even says the first one is free. What I don't understand is why I rarely get it with my order? I even made the effort to make sure it's clear being very polite that I want 4 sauces even having the order taker put the extra one on the order screen but when it's time to get my food the extra sauce is not there. Now after many, many times of this and trying many things to make sure I get it which to be honest is a real pain in the ass rather then just getting 4 sauces for all order automatically instead of 3 which is clearly not enough.   So how does a Sweet and Sour sauce cost 3120.00 or more? Well after literally years of playing this sick game and coming out the loser more often then a happy customer. I just stop going here as often as I once did. As a matter of fact I rarely go here now and stopped getting the 20 piece Chicken Mc nuggets so that I don't have to hassle with a order being wrong. Until today. Yes today the drive thru was empty and I was hungry. Instead of walking in to Food Source which is in the same parking lot to get a fully roasted Chicken, a soda and some chips for less than the cost of a 20 piece nuggets and 2 cheese burgers. I made the mistake of going to McDonalds. Well guess what I ordered 4 packs of sweet and sour and went to get my order and forgot to check my bag to make sure my order was correct (something a customer should not have to do!) When I left and was looking forward to eating food I've avoided now for about a year or more I was very disappointed again to see I was shorted my sauce. Now I know a sauce may seem like a small thing to stop doing business with a company for. But after awhile of regular poor customer service it's a sign the management and people don't really care about the customer experience in my opinion and experience and it's time to find other places to do business with. And that is exactly what I did! I took my 10.00 or more per visit 3-6 days a week, a average of 60.00 a week, to the competition. Now if you multiply 60.00 a week x 52 weeks a year what did that Sweet and Sour sauce cost Mc Donald's easily 3,120.00 a year!   Now I can't be the only person this happens to who has had enough of this poor business practice to short customers of their order's so the loss probably is more since I am sure other's who've had enough also found better places to spend their money.   I just hope Mc D's reconsiders this practice and give 1 sauce for ever 5 nuggets like they do on say a 10 piece order by itself. Why do they give 2 sauces on a 10 piece but only 3 on a more expensive 20 piece order? Stop with cutting corners and just give the customer a great experience it's not that hard. I hope ownership and management really figure out a way to solve this problem. Until then it will be at least another year until I spend my hard earned money with this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-rio-linda?osq=McDonald%27s&start=03483,75,5/24/17,2,"I've been going to this McDonalds for a long time, and I've had the few problems others have had such as a messed up order which has never been a huge deal to me, I can usually fix it on my own or get it fixed.

I did not take a picture of it because I noticed it when we were at the window and let the employee know, she got me a new one and realized her finger was cut open I saw her get a band aid there and then. My other reason happened today. I have been really sick and was really hungry so a roommate took me to get some food. I got a Big Mac, when we got home I took the pickles off like usual and noticed my patty was all kinds of torn up, like it had been thrown around. I was whatever about that thinking maybe it just got stuck to the grill. I started to eat my burger, the patty was cold but I was hungry. Then I saw a huge piece of plastic sticking out of my burger. I sat it down after that. I could not eat another bite.  I called the manager and they were nice but I feel like the employee who made the burger didn't care to make sure it was properly made and when it comes to food that scares me.
