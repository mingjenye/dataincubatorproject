1,0,11/8/2018,1.0,This establishment is just horrible!!!!!! The past few times I've came here with my wife they always mess up our order and the people are rude and have horrible customer service skills. I was asked to repeat my order 3 times and my order still wasn't right. I am DONE coming here! Don't waste your time,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-fresno-38?osq=McDonald%27s&start=0
2,0,10/13/2018,1.0,I went through the drive through and they were out of all drinks except coffee and smoothies  For someone who doesn't drink coffee you're forced to get a smoothie but because there is no other option  Because there is no other option you're forced to get it and you have to pay the difference  That's not fair to the consumer that none of there drinks never work  This is the second time in a week that they have messed up,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-fresno-38?osq=McDonald%27s&start=0
3,0,8/19/2018,1.0,"***DISCLAIMER*** I worked at a McDonald's when I was in high school back in the late 70s. You know, back in the days before computers told you what change you owed back to the customer. The days when you actually had to have simple money handling skills and count the customer's change back to them. Putting a food order together wasn't rocket science back then and because computers now do the work for the employees, it's even easier to do today. However, you have to be careful to check your order with this McD's as more often times then not your order is wrong or worst, the food has been sitting under the heating lamp way too long and should've been tossed. Today I ordered a large coffee with my sausage mcmuffin and (luke warm) hash brown. Imagine my surprise when taking the last drink of my coffee I got a mouth full of coffee grinds. McD's needs to take a page out of the In-N-Out playbook. In-N-Out is ALWAYS fresh, and they ALWAYS get your order right.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-fresno-38?osq=McDonald%27s&start=0
4,0,5/10/2017,1.0,"""Signature Crafted Recipe"" Burger leaves unintended impressions:  I saved up some calories to spend on McDonald's new signature burgers today. Yeah, I even ate the bun. I found the burger dull, poorly made, overpriced and not fresh. There was no 'craft' in the ""Crafted."" Just the burger and the large fries was over $9.00!  For those of you moaning about Steak 'n Shake, the McDonald's burger is much worse.  Although I thought the 'artisan bun' was good, it was not heated and caramelized on the grill like a good burger should be. This burger had no texture, the meat was dry and tasted like it had been overcooking in a drawer for hours. The cheese was too thin to taste, as was the bacon (not thick or even crispy). The assembly was too rushed and the sauce was a little dot in the middle of a bun. I HATE that and sent it back with the specifics I had asked for in the original order.  I knew that the burger would be terrible going in. I know they're trying but the execution and controls just aren't there. If your people can't even spread the condiments over the face of the bun, Step #1, Step #2 is going to be subpar too.  How hard is it to spread some sauce out on the buns, guys?  Although some folks might like that they're now bringing it to your table, I don't. Partly because I knew the order would be wrong, but also because it was just more efficient to have it handed to me and check. I'm also, go figure, one of these people who hates wasting things, even little things. I saw that the employees taking the food out were just assuming folks wanted ketchup and putting a hand full on the tray. I didn't want any and it's just more work touching stuff to bring it back to the counter instead of throwing it in the trash. None of this was upsetting. I knew going in...  Really, I even feel guilty taking all the packaging that comes with a meal at McDonald's. Those trash cans fill up FAST with one use only items that are just added to the customer's bill. It feels irresponsible. Excess packaging and boxes never makes burgers better. Having the food brought to the table is just problematic and this aspect of the hospitality didn't seem to be working. Observing the action in the restaurant, it seems that many trays being delivered were missing something and then required the employee to run around even more. How much easier it is just to wait by the counter and get what you need and check the order.  The bottom line is this, if you can't get the small stuff right, it's a mistake to add more and more to the menu. It just brings the quality down even further. I know it's counterintuitive but that was the reality here, poorly trained and poorly supervised kitchen people putting out poorly assembled food past its prime. What should have been a pretty simple burger, easily made, becomes a bum meal, a hassle and you're charged over $9.00 for it.  Lesson learned (glancing back to Steak n' Shake ((before quickly remembering Flame It!))! 'Flame It' nails all the negatives pointed out in this review and does it for 3-4 dollars less! Also Retro Junction! Now them is some burgers!  I hope this feedback is helpful,  -G",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-fresno-38?osq=McDonald%27s&start=0

When we pulled up to the window, she greeted us with a smile &amp; was peppy, I really appreciate that. Thank you Stephanie aka Tigger. Next, the woman at the second window was also very kind &amp; asked us to pull over as they're working on fresh fries.

The chicken was so tiny, nothing like the picture, it wasn't even the size of the bun! I also got a small petty little green leaf lettuce that was even smaller than the chicken.

I do have to agree with Paul M, the very first thing I noticed when I pulled in was the three panhandlers waiting to solicit customers for change.   I decided to take the drive thru instead and to my surprise there was another one sitting on the curb of the drive thru (Really?) It's really hard to avoid eye contact with a person 1ft away from your car making hand signals that he wants a hamburger. (Not cool) I don't mind purchasing food for the homeless but this was just uncomfortable. And you can tell every person ahead felt the same.    Needless to say management needs to work with the city to make the environment a little more enjoyable for their patrons.

Overblown, distorted and inaccurate marketing pictures continue to misrepresent what it is the consumer will actually receive. That's kinda lying, no? The burger I received was not plump and in fact was a squat puck or disk with no rounded quality as shown in the picture.  Squirty condiments that are blobbed on will never create the flavor and tongue feel of mayo, mustard and ketchup that is spread out over the entire surface of the bun. You will always get 'sections' of condiments in some areas and nothing in others.  As I've said before, I NEVER get the fries unless the oil is freshly changed and the color is very light. This works out well for me since the oil is normally old and broken down creating a fry with bad texture and a terrible after taste that creeps up on you.  Read: I don't get them often!

You have homeless still outside, I saw one sleeping in the bushes, then there's the panhandlers, OK I can get by that but now there's this group of kids, and I mean KIDs, cursing and talking loud, and picking on patrons. The girl in this group looked not a day over 10 wanting to pick a fight with an adult patron! Last night one of the kids wanted an item a patron had and when the patron refused to give it up they threw soda and food trays in his face then jumped him and started beating on him, NOBODY from the staff came out to help this guy, so I gathered my things to get up and help when one of the kids ran by and tried to take my cellphone out of my hand, by this time a handicap man got up and threatened to spray them with pepper spray, that's when they left running out the store. The patron they beat on was injured and had his face all bloody, and his radio broken and property scattered all over the floor.

50,2,9/10/2016,2.0,"They seem to do a 2-star job here. Despite being too salty, the biscuits and gravy is delicious. I'd be happy if they just held the biscuits and gave me a bucket of the gravy!  Unless the fries have freshly changed oil used to cook them, they taste awful and leave a lingering aftertaste. In an unlikely form of gratitude, this keeps me from eating them but a few times a year since you can tell just by watching them come out (by the color) whether or not the oil is fresh. It also bugs me that when you do buy a large, it's almost $3.00 and the sleeve isn't filled like it should be.  When the stars do align, I've been known to just buy 2 large to get my 'fry on.' Really not much else on the menu is very good. Inferior burgers relying largely on the cheap bun for bulk. That always goes in the trash...  I loath the use of their lettuce which offers NO texture or flavor and is only there because it won't go brown after sitting for days. It's so thin and essentially useless in adding interest, texture or flavor.  The breakfast burritos are a joke, rubber-like. Thing is, any of this garbage fills your stomach. But by that reasoning, so would a piece of tanbark, which would be far more healthy.  I must say, I have enjoyed the sausage mc muffins. Despite being far too salty, when cooked fresh, they're great. I love the slight spice. Love that slight char of the English muffin texture with butter and then the meat.... I never add egg here since it's overcooked and too much like rubber.  The smartest thing this company did was in deciding to use real butter again. Mc Duh!  Interestingly, their restaurants in Europe use far better quality overall. People there wouldn't buy it otherwise since they're entirely more attuned to quality in their food. The bread/buns are substantially better quality (choose your type) and you can get blue cheese, emmental, Gruyere, etc. Some of those locations are two stories and they're tech marvels. At the Louvre in Paris, they have kiosks where you tap in your order and pay, all without using a cashier or getting in a line (if you want). Then you just pick your food up at the window. Eating quality McDonalds a few stories underground, 20ft away from an underground 12th century French castle/fortress, and a palace built in the 1500's above you was surreal. The restaurants are marvels of cutting edge design, interior and exteriors unlike anything seen in our area.   On the other hand, I hated their fries which were more Belgian-like.  In conclusion, McDonalds, please to change your oil. It's almost certainly past the due date.  -G",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-fresno-18?osq=McDonald%27s&start=0

Bad because I have gotten into the habit of chewing ice and bad because I hit several Mickey D's daily because of it. But I think that is going to change--tonight I waited in the drive-up for at least 10 minutes and when I got to the window I was handed a drink with hardly any ice--asked for more as that was my original order and the gal obliged me. Got home to take a swig and found that I was befouled with Dr. Pepper--not diet Coke. To me Dr. Pepper tastes like carbonated prune juice--it is disgusting. This is not the only Mc Donald's in town that consistently screws things up. At the Mc Donald's at Herndon and Cedar after receiving my soda and realizing that it hardly had any ice, I drove directly around to the other side, got out of the car, and marched over to the soda machine to add the correct amount of ice--I was quickly questioned by a Manager asking me what I was doing--evidently he thought I was a street cretin who came in with an old cup to swipe soda. Without even looking at him and continuing my business, I explained that I was adding the ice that I had requested that his hired help was unable or unwilling to provide me. He walked away. Also at that location I had one of the ""higher"" employees (he had on a white shirt instead of the regular polo shirts) came over to hand me a cone and I had to remind him that I had ordered a dipped cone--he went back dipped it and handed it to me, then came back with my soda----again it was wrong. Had to send him back to get some ice. And why is it when a customer has the large order from hell they let them clog up the drive through instead of having them pull off to a waiting space? Another pet peeve I have is if I order a soda and a cone, why am I being handed the cone first? I have no where to put it when you hand me the soda and straw and it is dripping and unless I ask it has not occurred to you people that this drippy cone could really use a napkin with it?

I'm not sure what in the hell the major malfunction is at this particular McDonalds, but  I am so done. I only go here in the name of convenience when I'm in a hurry, starving, and have to run by Save Mart since it's in the same shopping center. The thing is, when they get your order wrong every single time, it just isn't very convenient is it?   I wish I could say I was kidding but they have seriously gotten my order wrong EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. I order Sweet Tea, I get Raspberry Sweet Tea. I order a McDouble Big Kids Meal, I get nuggets. I specify light condiments, no tomatoes, I get tomatoes and no condiments. Today I order a Deluxe QP meal which she assures me is an ordinary QP with yellow cheese, red onion, lettuce, and tomato, I get a lousy Bacon QP with lettuce, bacon, and no onion.   WTF is really going on in there that even when you repeat an order twice they still can't manage to fill it correctly? EVER?  I have no idea and I no longer care. Eating here is like shooting Craps and frankly, I don't like gambling with my food. Now that I've come to this particular page and I see the other reviews, it's clear that they couldn't care less about their crappy service either based on the lack of responses and the grossly apparent lack of effort at customer satisfaction. Can you imagine if every store took your money up front and then threw whatever the hell they felt like into your bags the way this place does?  Ugh.  If you like not getting what you pay for, or the idea of every meal being a mystery, coupled with blatant disregard, go here. Otherwise, avoid this place like you'd avoid  a cockroach infested plague fest. Even if you're desperately hungry and in a real hurry, just don't bother with this stinker. Buy a roasted chicken while you're in Save Mart and eat that sucker on the road, mess and all. Get one of their deli sammies. Hell, buy a crappy Slim-Jim and a soda at SaveMart.

Before I made it in the store, there was a male employee on his break (sitting in his car smoking) that kept staring at me, making me feel uncomfortable. Right then I should've got back in my car and drove off.   I go inside and place my order. I had been in days prior to a somewhat untidy store to grab a quick bite, but I wanted to reward myself with a frappe after dealing with 'The People of Walmart.'   The restaurant still had dirty tables and floors and a lot of homeless people loitering in the lobby, just as it had on my prior visit.   While waiting for my order I went to use the restroom. There was a woman who was full on washing herself in the sink and applying her makeup. Had I accidentally walked into someone's bathroom??? She abruptly left, leaving all of her used 'supplies' on the counter. This is something that doesn't seem to be new, as I've seen others mention it in their reviews, and is something that management needs to get under control.   The bathroom was not stocked, and was filthy. There's no way the employees don't see it. The hand dryer didn't work, some towels would've been nice...although one wouldn't have been able to reach the sink due to the bathing beauty (bring some hand sanitizer).   My frappe was decent, they made it but let it sit on the counter for a minute so it became like soup. I thought they would remake a whole new one but all they did was throw it back in the blender and add more ice. The end result was a chocolate chippy crushed ice drink.

Recently at this Mc Donald's on 12/29/17 at 11:50pm I recently received a green egg Mc Muffin as you can check out the picture.   When I ordered my Egg Mc Muffin I was so happy to chow down on it once I got home. I took my first bite and it taste weird, so I thought maybe it is just me so I took another bite and almost threw up and spit out the food from my mouth, and noticed green spots inside the EGG on the Mc Muffin, I showed each family member including my uncle who is an food expert. The egg Mc Muffin smelled bad and each member informed me that the egg Mc Muffin smelled spoiled too and it did.  I wanted to go back that night, however I would like to speak to the manager. I saved the sandwich and the recite. I called Mc Donald's in the morning and spoke to the manager who was very sweet about the situation and apologized and offered to replace the food item, which is unacceptable for me at this time. The manager informed me to come in around 12 or 1pm to talk to Upper Management that would be coming in.  I arrive around 1:50pm and informed the manager of what occurred. The Upper Manager informed me that it is ""old eggs"" I got served, I informed the manager that it is unacceptable to be served OLD EGGS to a customer and she ask me if she could redo the sandwich, NOPE, the manager offered a refund for the sandwich which I did not want to make a scene or off put others who were ordering so I obliged. I ask the manager again how could this happen to my sandwich and she said Old Eggs when they sit out to long.... I ask her if that is acceptable to serve a customer Old Eggs that can make someone sick she did not respond....I had to leave because I was ticked.  I called MC Donald's Customer Service right after to inform them of this practices at this Mc Donald's corporate at 1-800-244-6227 and spoke to Destiny who was really helpful, she took down the report and informed me that the district/regional or owner will get back to me to resolve this situation, I informed her that the manager did give me a refund but I hope no one else gets served OLD EGGs as I did.

They told us that during the holiday season they would only accept cash for orders over $25. Where is the logic in this?!?! A credit card can be verified through an ID check, a debit card will process immediately. How is this acceptable?

We came to this McDonald's for our morning coffee group since the one near Bullard &amp; Blackstone is undergoing extensive renovations. Now, perhaps we've been spoiled by going to the same McDonald's several times a week for the last several years. We've gotten to know the staff and the managers and, in most cases, become friends with them.  That is not, and will never be the case, with the McDonald's in the Save Mart shopping center near First and Nees.  Much of the staff is rude and/or incompetent. They can't be bothered to put the cream and Equal in your coffee, as requested; they just toss it on the tray with your food items and look at you like, ""Yeah? So what? Deal with it."" The simplest orders are screwed up. For example, is it really that hard to make the biscuit in a sausage biscuit well-done? Apparently, for these folks, it is.  The inside of the restaurant is so freezing cold that you have to either (a) wear gloves and a parka (in the middle of July), or (b) sit outside on filthy chairs at filthy tables where the homeless have been hanging out overnight. Although, to be fair to the homeless, they typically have a better attitude than the workers &amp; managers inside.  What does this McDonald's need?

I had finally managed to open the door to the restroom when an employee of yours while sitting and eating with a manager; hostily screamed at me to ""not to take a bath in the restroom."" #wtf It didn't make sense due to the fact that this was my first visit at The McDonald's or to my knowledge seen any of these employees in my life. I asked her to repeat herself and she did in the manner of a grade school student not to take a bath and wash that hair in the sink, and that she just had washed the bathrooms.

The same order she places at other McDonald's restaurants every other day. When she got to the windrow she got the order and asked why the additional charge? The employee did not know why the order was almost $2 more than usual. As she's pulling away, she noticed meat on the sandwich, which will make her extremely sick. So she went inside and asked to speak to a ""manager"" (some Hispanic lady with a shitty attitude) asked her what was wrong. She explained that she's allergic to meat, so the ""manager"" opens her biscuit sandwiches, pulls out the meat, places the meat on the counter, folds the biscuits back up in the same wrapper, and hands them to her. My friend was disgusted with the poor manners and customer service. She asked for a corporate phone number and the ""managers"" reply was, ""You have google right? Look it up."" Two other customers who witnessed the altercation told the ""manager"" they've never seen such rude behavior, and they both walked out without even ordering. They were appalled at her ridiculous attitude! McDonald's has long been known for their remarkable customer service, but this location needs to be reclaimed by corporate and needs to have every single employee reassessed for future employment. Never go to this location! If we boycott this location, hopefully it'll go out of business! And the ""manager"" needs to be terminated immediately! The customer is always right, but not at this location!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-fresno?osq=McDonald%27s&start=40
340,14,7/26/2015,1.0,"McDonald's is the place that I always get my breakfast and I am usually pleased with their service, but today was the worst experience ever. After my 3-day camping trip with my family, we were exhausted and decided to stop by this McDonald's before beginning our 6-hour drive back to SoCal. I was expecting the phenomenal service that I am used to but it was the complete opposite this time. From the moment I got to the register to order breakfast, a cashier named Vanessa welcomed me with a horribly sour attitude, she refused to make eye contact with me and lacked the upbeat, cheery attitude of most McDonald's employees. My family and I are of Hispanic decent and while she was rude to us, I couldn't help but notice that she was courteous and respectful to the Caucasian customers. She herself was Hispanic, as well. Perhaps she grew up surrounded by Caucasian people and that is why she was much kinder to them. She humiliated me and made me feel inferior because of my race. However, Vanessa was not the only unruly employee. At one point, my daughter went up to the another cashier and politely asked for hot sauce. The cashier rudely shoved a handful of hot sauce into my young daughter's hands. I was appalled when my daughter told me of the incident. Again, they had made us feel blatantly unwelcome to this supposed family-friendly restaurant. In addition, the kitchen staff was loud and obnoxious with employees distracting each other with flirtatious comments and phone calls (Vanessa). To be completely honest, this visit was the worst $40 I have ever spent. I suggest that these employees be reminded of their customer service training because they made this visit truly awful.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-fresno?osq=McDonald%27s&start=40

OK, I'll start with a disclaimer: BEWARE of flying packets of strawberry jam being flung into car windows by a lazy, broodish assistant manager who selfishly took it upon herself to give me my food the WAY she wanted to hand over the food, rather than abide to a request of placing everything in the bag first, then handing everything over.  Right when I pull up, I suggest,"" extra jam please"". And, like a stranded dog in an empty parking lot, she freezes with bag in hand, then turns slightly, then turns back to me....I suggest further, ""yea, place the packets in the bag please, then give me the bag"". BUT NOOO, this lazy bitch insists I take the bag first..for whatever reason, like twice pushing the bag my way like she was some street-vendor pushing her hand-made crap for me to buy, so I gave in, and took the bag..then she leaves her post..and comes back with the packets of jam, and then...FLINGS the packets into my window trying to aim for my bag, which was practically in the center rest of my car!?!?! One I catch in my arms, the other falls between my seat and door. Unbelieveable!   I immediately, yell, ""COME ON!!!"" ..Then, I get pissed, and yell, ""WHY DIDN'T you just keep the bag?! I told you to keep the bag and place the jam in the bag""...after which, she just closed the window.   Effin' bitch. I called the 800 number on the bag and filed a complaint with corporate, hope she gets fired.

Sure enough, there was one super close around the corner so we made a u-turn and headed back.  Any thought of a McDonald's takes me back to high school, being old enough to have access to a meal pass, and being one of the cool kids that showed their meal pass at the gate and were allowed to go off campus to any of the 3 or 4 fast food places in the tiny town of Kerman and McDonald's happened to be one of them along with Taco Bell and Round Table Pizza.  At McDonalds, I would always get the Big Mac and fries.  If anything, their fries have always been really good and of course the apple pie.  Today, we got the apple pies that come two for $1.  We also noticed pumpkin pie on the menu and not wanting to miss out on seasonal items, we decided to grab a couple of those as well.  We took them to go and enjoyed them at home.  The pies come in small boxes, they're hand held and enough for 4 quick bites.  Unfortunately, the pumpkin pie was a disappointment.  The filling didn't taste like pumpkin or much of anything and it was salty. The crust was heavily over spiced with cinnamon. The apple pie was the clear winner.  It's always been consistent from one McDonald's location to the next and best enjoyed hot so ask for the fresh batch.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-clovis-7?osq=McDonald%27s&start=20

I said MOST are wrong because I have ran into a female employee that was cussing and seemed like she could care less about her job and we had a few mistakes with our orders. The female was going home when we arrived so it wasn't that bad but I could see if someone had to deal with that earlier I would be upset too. The mistakes were fixed right away with no hassle. We have come probably about every 2 weeks or so. It is always cool and clean. My kids play in the play area and I know it is dirty, but we bathe them as soon as we get home. Any place like this is going to be dirty, kids can be messy. I looked in the play areas at both local Chuck e cheese locations and it was pretty much the same. Yes it's gonna have a smell, have you seen how many kids spill things? I just had my daughter's birthday party here last night and it was wonderful! We also had my son's birthday party here in June and it was just as wonderful. The staff is very attentive to your needs and is quick to take care of stuff.

I counted 3-4 people. Ordered the black coffee and had to wait while the cashier helped fill drive-thru orders. While waiting, two customers came in from the drive-thru. The first woman was given somebody else's bag of food and they almost gave her order to the next person in drive-thru until they stopped it. Another woman came in cause something in the happy meal box messed up, but she said she ordered a mini meal and not a happy meal. Finally got the coffee and left.   I remember a year or two ago I ate at this location and I literally broke their employees. They sell fresh baked cookies 2 for $1, but before it used to be 3 for 99¢. The McDonald's I usually go to already changed prices and sometimes McDonald's vary by prices according to franchise and location. Since the menu said 3 for 99¢ I asked how much cookies were and pointed out the menu price and she had to give it to me for that price.

Just the review of my experience.  It was sad for us, but thought I'd let everyone know that this independently owned franchisee doesn't participate in the FRESNO COUNTY reading program.  So, instead of buying my son his $1.00 cone there, we drove to the next one and bought my daughters happy meal and my coffee and turned the card in there.  But thought I'd save y'all a trip before the manager sends your kid away from their $1.00 cone redemption.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-fresno-2?osq=McDonald%27s&start=20
