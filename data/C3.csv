More garbage and food on the floor.    The only staff person that was nice was the girl who took our order.  She was the only person I saw clean at any point either.  Younger thin girl with dark hair and a braid if I recall correctly.    The person who appeared to be the person in charge, heavier set lady in a blue shirt was talking bad about customers to another employee loud enough I could hear her.  She also never acknowledged us during the visit, till the end.  We thought we'd find a place to sit down but most of the tables were dirty and had flies around them.  We thought maybe the kids room would be cleaner.  There was food smeared on the floor, garbage literally overflowing from the trash can onto the floor and dirty socks hanging around?   Again the only person we saw come around to clean was the girl who cashed us out and she was wiping down tables.  When we finished our food I went back in the check the garbage on the floor situation and expected to see the manager or SOMEONE cleaning up the giant mess all over the place but two employees were sitting down on their phones as was the lady in the blue shirt.  We asked who the manager was and the girl said she didn't know but the lady in the blue shirt told us who the GM was and looked worried.  Had I not lost the receipt (not for refund just time and day so he could review cameras) I 100% would have returned with this and told him about how his store is being run when he is not there.  This was about 2.5 weeks ago.    Also, garbage cans outside?  Overflowing into the parking lot.    DISGUSTING Never going back :)",https://www.yelp.com//biz/mcdonalds-chico-2?osq=McDonald%27s12,0,2/3/15,1,WAY TOO MUCH SALT ON THE FRIES.

PLEASE SHARE: My 67 year old father went to the McDonald's across from Pleasant Valley High School in Chico California this past Friday (9/23/2016). He brought in his own cup so he was not wasting a cup which he has done for years.  He paid the employee at the counter $1.08 for a soda and walked over to the machine to start filling his cup.  A man in all black walked over to him and said, ""You need to pay for that ""my father said ""Oh, I paid for this, I am just re-using a cup so I'm not wasting a cup"", the man said to him again, ""you need to pay for that, let me see your receipt.""  My Dad said to the man, ""You are not trying to accuse me of stealing this are you?""  The man then said to my father, ""Shut the f*** up"".  The employee that took my father's money verified that he had paid for the drink.  My Dad told the man that his employee had just verified that he had in fact paid for the drink and my Dad was once again told to ""shut the f*** up"".  My Dad asked for his money back and said that he would leave he again was told to ""shut the f*** up"" again and a few more times after that.  My Dad asked to speak to the manager and he was told by the man in all black that he was the owner so there would be no talking to anyone higher then him.  The owners name is Mark Burington and when my father asked for the corporate number Mr. Burington refused to give it to him.  So he went home and with the help of my step-mom, they were able to find a local corporate number.  As they told their story, they were hung up on.  We now know that Mr. Burington owns all of the local McDonalds so that corporate number he called was the one for his stores. (Update: he owns most of, if not all of the Butte county McDonalds) At the time this was occurring, there were about 20 students from the high school across the street standing in the same area watching and listening to this happen.  My father was embarrassed, disparaged and slandered in front of all of these young men and women.  He also felt very threatened and unsafe being in the establishment.  But putting aside my father's feelings, I have strong concerns over what happened in front of these young people and the McDonalds employees. A complaint has been filed with the Better Business Bureau and local media will be contacted but no story will probably ever show up because McDonalds is a huge advertiser so I am hoping this will get shared.  I am concerned over this uncontrollable man that lashed out with inappropriate language.  I understand that McDonalds is a franchise and individual owners own each restaurant but shouldn't there be some accountability for these owners to represent the McDonalds ""Ambition"" stated right on the company website?... ""Our purpose goes beyond what we sell. We're using our reach to be a positive force. For our customers. Our people. Our communities. Our world.""  Nothing about this owner or my father's experience was positive.  Being a ""Good Neighbor"" is also stated right on the McDonalds website, ""We champion happy, healthy kids. Keep families together through Ronald McDonald House Charities. Commit to reducing our footprint. Using less energy. And recycling more.""  My father was trying to reduce our footprint by recycling his cup but was degraded and threatened for doing so.  Look at the yelp reviews of this place... it sounds like my father has not been the first to be treated horribly. Until this mess is resolved and McDonalds removes a hostile man from being around children and our community, I would strongly urge the Chico Community to boycott all McDonalds owned by Mr. Burington.  Especially if you have kids that attend PV.h",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-chico-7?osq=McDonald%27s&start=2047,1,3/2/17,1,This owner is a poor representation for the MacDonalds corporation.

So from now on, I will have to go in to the store to make sure they get it right. These issues only started happening within the past 6 months or so, so maybe something has changed for the worst recently.  Here's the situation: I order a Quarter Pounder Deluxe meal every time. I typically order it with no pickles or onions, but I've started not making it a special order, so that I'll maybe actually get the right thing. That doesn't work. 3 times out of 5 they give me a regular quarter pounder with cheese instead of the Deluxe. Which means no mayo and no veggies other than pickles and onions.  I even order it by using the meal combo number and they still give me the wrong burger. I sent my boyfriend to get it for me last night, he said the lady told him ""the regular quarter pounder with cheese is cheaper"" he said ""no it's fine"", they still gave him the quarter pounder with cheese instead of the deluxe. Are they trying to save on lettuce and tomato or something? Why would they downsell that? They also shorted us an order of fries last night. And one of the few times when they actually did give me the deluxe... it was missing the burger patty and cheese! It was just mayo, lettuce, and tomato on a bun! I was on my lunch break at work so I couldn't just go back and get the correct order so I threw some fries on it and had me a fry sandwich.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-yuba-city?osq=McDonald%27s&start=0298,10,3/3/17,5,This McDonald's has NEVER messed up my order and the staff is very polite.

To start, a friend and I pulled into the drive thru and up to the speaker to order. We ask the girl for six egg mcmuffins, but we needed two without Canadian bacon. We had to repeat this about five times to her as she kept asking about sausage mcmuffins (an honest mistake, whatever). After multiple attempts to explain what we needed, she was not understanding and rudely asked us to pull up to the window because ""she couldn't understand us"". We eventually got up to the window, where she finally was able to take our order. We then pulled up to the second window, when a guy kindly told us that our food would be a minute and we should pull up on the side to wait. We waited maybe five minutes (no big deal at all) when a woman comes up (very closely) to the window with our food. We roll down the window only to have this woman LECTURE US on how inconsiderate it is to order breakfast food after 11am (even thought McDonalds CLEARLY advertises all-day-breakfast!) because the bfast food is made to order. (Side note: In N Out ALWAYS does made-to-order, but you don't see them bitching at customers about their job!). After a worthless two minute lecture, we finally drove away with our food. As we're driving away I look at all the egg mcmuffins and they all have Canadian bacon. This happens to me often, and it's an honest mistake. So we turn the car around, walk inside, wait in line, and the girl at the register goes to get a manager. Now let me tell you, this manager was beyond rude. After the girl at register had told her about our issue, the manager did everything in her power to make us wait for her. After waiting for five minutes for this woman, she finally rudely tells us to come over. ""What's the problem?"" she says in a rude tone. We repeat the situation, AGAIN, and instead of apologizing or offering us compensation, she tells us to give her two of the mcmuffins, throws them away right in front of us, and has one of her employees give us the new ones. Never an apology from this manager, just a crap attitude towards two polite customers over her stores mistake. We never acted rude or impatient, we smiled and assured them the order mess up wasn't a big deal, because it really wasn't!

For dinner tonight, I really wanted a salad because I haven't much fruits or vegetables all day today since my husband and I were stuck in the car driving all day from Oregon this morning.   So I decided to stop by here to order the following:  Southwest Grilled Chicken Salad- This salad comes with a small amount of yellow corn &amp; black beans, Romaine lettuce with some general salad mix (dark green leafys), a few thinly sliced carrot pieces, a small amount of raw shredded cheese and south west seasoned corn chips. South west dressing is on the side in a very large dressing pouch. I had ordered this entree a few times and I felt that the salad portion of salad was on the small side and seemed to be smaller than usual.   Double Cheeseburger- Pretty standard, but my hungry husband devoured it.  ----------------------------------- (Total= $8.31 after tax)  We made our order via drive through and the wait was pretty long which surprised me because there was only 1 person at the register inside.

Aren't these supposed to be open during business hours? -The fry boxes were barely squeezed open (this is was the first part of being nickel-ed and dime-ed) Arggghh!  See picture, none yet eaten!  I figured this was intentional as store was crowded and this I figured is why they were stuffed in bag- I would have noticed if on tray.  These were less than half full.  -What I learned much later, when reading the receipt is that my two for $4, half full fries were actually charged at the regular price of two medium fries!  So another $0.30 extra, but what bothers me about this most is that I clearly told the clerk 2 for 4 or whatever, why would their registers even allow this and it dawned on me....$0.30 x millions sold per day is a lot of money for McDs.  I see a class action here!   Overall food was tasty, but the other things so turned me off, last straw  for me and reason we now search for (in and out) or (the habit) is over this crazy menu issue.  Hwy 99 from now on...there's an In-N-Out on the way.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-colusa?osq=McDonald%27s&start=0446,15,1/27/18,1,"Easy as 1,2,3 menu, sucks.

I decided I would combine my experiences-  1st trip- Despite having just read a Buzzfeed article on the amount of chemicals and artificial junk put into a strawberry shake here, I went ahead an ordered on. Received said shake and my experience was as follows: employee hands me shake dripping in melted milkshake and mysterious red juice, I take shake and as I am moving the shake from my left hand to my right hand to set it in the cup holder, the lid comes flying off and the cherry that was placed on top of the shake falls onto the floor of my car. Driving away I reached into my bag for a napkin to wipe up the sticky mess that was all over my hands and car and to my dismay, there were none to be found. 2nd trip- against better judgement I went through again, this time ordering a cheeseburger (I know, don't judge me. I was starving). Received order, opened up, only to find that the plastic yellow garbage they are supposed to place on top of the burger (I know, that's what I get for going here in the first place) was not even on my burger, but rather melted to the paper wrapper. Instead of the normally small chunks of onion that are sprinkled on top of the patty, I received a full, thick chunk of uncooked onion on top of the burger, and no pickles (fine I hate pickles anyway). My fries were not only cold, but they were soggy and brown. My drink had about 2 sips and the rest was ice.

If you've had a bad experience here take the time to read through my review.  I would like to start off by saying this location is a very busy, off the interstate multi-million dollar McDonalds. Unfortunately the general manager here, Irma, is a complete moron. She's a nice lady at the root, but is incredibly incompetent when it comes to leading a team that fits the needs of a store of this magnitude. The only reason she is the boss is because she has been working there since she was 16 and somehow managed to make her way up the ladder. She promotes and assigns people to stations based on personal relationships and not merit. She micromanages to the point that the staff is so confused about the goals that it's utter and compete chaos. And worse of all all the staff there is immensely undertrained. My first day there was the Saturday before Thanksgiving, and I was thrown at a computer taking orders with absolutely no prior knowledge of McDonalds and the food they sold. After that I had to figure everything out myself, and was constantly reprimanded for not following McDonalds protocol. We were told to be friendly and take the time to make sure everything was made right and up to par but were only given 90 seconds from the customer ordering, to leaving with their food to do so (and we were yelled at if we went over our time).  If you ever come to this location and have a bad experience don't bother calling and telling Irma because she'll more than likely laugh and make fun of your complaint with her staff (I speak from experience, I had to kiss her butt in order to get more than 15 hours a week). I suggest calling the corporate office, or finding the number for their Yuba City office who is Irma's direct higher up.

As you can see, my experience was less than impressive. Let's start with the good and go from there.   Good: The restaurant is in a good location. You are out of the Sacramento so it's a good place to get lunch either leaving from or heading to. It is in a good location and getting on and off the freeway is easy. By the way, there is a Chevron near there. Don't go to it. Their gas is about 50 cents more than the other stations around. Back to McDonalds. It is also really clean. They also have 2 of the Coke machines which are awesome. I actually gave them a star back because of that. That's about it for the good.   Bad: Ok, first and foremost they got my order wrong. I ordered the 10 piece McNugget meal. I got 10 chicken tenders, no meal so not even close. Minus 1 star. Secondly, the tenders I did not order were completely gristle and gross. So had I ordered them, or anyone else, they would have been disappointed. Minus 1 star. Thirdly, and the reason I didn't complain about getting my order wrong, the person in front of me got their order wrong too. When they tried to tell the cashier about it he just stared and nothing was ever corrected. So no customer service. Minus 1 star. And lastly, the place was full of flies. They were everywhere. It was annoying trying to eat with all the little things flying around your food. Something needs to be done about that. Minus 1 star.   So overall, not happy with the experience there.

There were children with us and we figured walking would be a little easier, with the inside being closed we were trying to walk through the drive thru. We knocked on the door to let them know we were trying to order food and they shook their heads and told us to get out.

There is a mcdonalds in every ghetto, in every up town center, and even in most walmarts. Still there are good one's and bad one's. This one is a good one.

The staff is pleasant in my experiences and the food as expected is always hot and made to order.   The bathroom is a single user set up which can really suck when you want to wash your and your childs hands before eating and a homeless person has decided to take a hoe bath. But it is usually clean and doesn't smell too bad for a bathroom.   They are open late on the weekends, at least the drive thru is.

Most recently with the lettuce in my chicken sandwich I ordered.It looked like it had been scooped out of the dish disposal, raunchy and gross. Maybe it was the chicken sandwich that was under the heat lamp all day , Apart from that everything else is just fine. Today I ordered a small fries and a large Sprite with the new $1 chicken sandwich it comes with chicken mayonnaise and a leaf of iceberg lettuce. After I ate the sandwich after about 20 minutes I noticed I had to use the bathroom like I never before then after that , one more time and I just hope I can get back to feeling normal again ASAP. The lettuce was below industry standards in my opinion; I think I was foolish to eat it but I was hungry and now I'm paying for it. I hope my visits to the bathroom slow down because before I ate there I was fine, I would like to say my Sprite was perfect and my small french fries scrumptious the bread was perfect chicken perfect.
