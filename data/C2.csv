Only REASON this place is getting 2 stars is because of employee Jesse. I think the manager is a female who closely resembles bride of chucky with her EXTREMELY DARK eye/lip makeup and quite frankly looks kinda freaky but if shes not and somebody else is then it's time they step down and hand the ropes over to Jesse and allow him to take control. His personality is TO DIE FOR. Hes funny, witty, very nice and respectful. Even took a few moments to say hello to my 8mo son AS HE WAS WALKING AROUND THE RESTAURANT MAKING SURE ALL CUSTOMERS WERE HAPPY. NEVER IN MY 27 YEARS of life have i seen a MCDonald's employee do that. I can't even tell you how many times i heard the employees drop the F-bomb or other foul language while I was trying to enjoy lunch with my son and the couple of flys that decided to join us even though they werent invited. They just kept flying around my son and i and landing on our food!! The bathrooms are so disgusting. Toilet paper thrown all around the stalls and human feces on the toilet seat. Not going to lie, I arrived needing to tinkle extremely bad and i still need to because i REFUSED to put my body anywhere near those toilet seats. I do believe you could easily catch a life threatening disease just from breathing the air in that bathroom or even make a couple new cockroach friends while in there. I hope the management of this establishment reads this so they can finally hand over this shit show to Jesse and let him turn it into a Mcdonald's that people actually want to come to.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-sacramento-24?osq=McDonald%27s&start=01,0,11/12/18,1,This is by far the worst service a McDonald's can offer anyone.

The hours posted on Google and Yelp (at the time at least) were inaccurate and in reality the store was open, but for Drive Thru orders only.  After walking up and seeing this, I approached the Drive Thru windows, hands up, to be clear I wasn't looking for trouble. I made myself visible from more than 30 or so feet away and caught the attention of an employee who waived and walked away without opening the window. This happened a second time with a different employee. Finally, on the third attempt to get someone's attention, they opened the window to tell me they would not serve me, they gave no explanation as to why, and they slammed the window shut.  It was frustrating having walked there for nothing, but I assume the policy exists for employee safety, and I didn't intend to argue it.  A day or two later I came into the restaurant with my children and a friend. I mentioned to the Manager taking my order how I'd been frustrated with the refusal of service. He made no apologies and offered no thanks for my patronage. He said they don't serve walk ups as they're always ""homeless or drunk and never up to any good.""  Not sure if I looked homeless or intoxicated, and I didn't take it personally, but he was rude and it was embarrassing with my friend and kids there.  We got our meal quickly but my friend brought his back, as it was someone else's order. We then waited more than 15 minutes for him to receive an incomplete version of his actual order. 0-2. We got no apologies and ten minutes later when following up, the Manager offered him a partial refund as he didn't know when my friend's order would be ready. Still no apology, and all the while he was short and rude.  I've had several interactions with staff here and seen no attempt at warmth or customer support worthy of retention.

And also its location, makes it nice to frequent the place. Unfortunately, I had an unpleasant exchange of words with the store manager, BEATRIZ (she didn't give us her last name).  I had a prior incident with her at a different McDonalds branch (Laguna blvd, near target) where she gave me an attitude when I complained about a missing milk in my son's happy meal (it happens a lot, they often  mess up orders). Instead of being apologetic, she was so rude and bitchy. She even told me to call the corporate office if I had a problem, so I did. She probably knows that even if you file/call a complaint to the corporate office, nothing will happen. (She was correct!!!), nothing happened and she still works for Mcdonalds with an attitude. Since my son loves going to McDonalds for their toys in the happy meal and the play gym, I tried to ignore this BITCH. But today, at this McDonalds (arco am/pm -Sheldon rd &amp; 99), she's the one that handed me the cup for my drink and told me ""WHY ARE YOU FOLLOWING ME?! (with an attitude).  I am a paying customer, I'm entitled to eat at any McDonalds I want to go to. I don't get my food free. I PAY FOR IT. She even threatened me and my husband that she will ban us from Mcdonalds. REALLY???!!! As if I will loose a lot from not eating at McDonalds (everyone knows its the unhealthiest food on earth! But we do like it). This is a franchise store, so with this kind of employee, the owner will be the one to feel the heat or loose the income. I hope the owner of this franchise will find time to read all the reviews and see how fucked up all his/her employees are.   If I could rate this experience with a negative star, I would...  P.S. And to the store manager, BEATRIZ, please think about your employer. He/She has invested a lot of money into this business, you might only work there for a certain amount of time, but this business is their livelihood. This is the way they make their money, and they keep a lot of other employees there besides you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-elk-grove-11?osq=McDonald%27s&start=20170,3,9/21/16,1,"WARNING:THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN FOUL LANGUAGE  OK so where do I begin with these damn dumbasses??! Every time I go they manage to fuck up my order! In one occasion I ordered a happy meal for my kid and when they gave me the food I specifically asked the girl handing me my food if his apple juice was in the bag and she said yes so I drive off and when I open the bag to give my kid his juice it wasn't there! Not a big deal u might think but when u are running late and rushing to get somewhere u simply don't have time to drive back curse the stupid employees out and get a damn apple juice! The second time I came here I ordered a #9 which obviously it includes the fries and drinks but when I pull up to the window to receive my meal I made sure to open the bag up before I drove off and guess what? My fries where missing!! Wow! Oh and it only gets better! When I asked for my fries it was like if I where asking for the whole fucken menu for free or something! The manager was a dumb bitch asking for my receipt which I automatically throw away so she prints out a new one and shows me that I didn't order fries.. umm hello?? I said a number 9 don't u know that means the whole meal??( Which I didn't understand how they managed to give me my drink and not the fries) so this lady wanted me to pay for my fries which I thought she should just give them to me for free since I waited for 20 minutes but I'm not that type of person trying to get a free meal out of McDonald's so I said yes I'll pay the difference to make it a meal so she want to charge me $3 more which was stupid because I had pay $6 dollars already for the burger and drink! So I said no honey I'm not about to pay $9 for a meal. So since they apparently don't have a braid I did the math for her and told her I only had to pay $1 and some change which I did and they gave me the fries. I was just in shocked that they had me go through all that bullshit just for some crappy fries and still had the audacity to charge me! Uugghhh!! And the third third time I went which was my last time I ordered my kid 2 beef patties with cheese because he doesn't eat the bread just the meat (he's a toddler) these geniuses packed the meat upside down which made the cheese stick to the cardboard box and left with nasty ass patty without the cheese, it was basically a cardboard cheese burger!

The order was: 2 McDoubles Plain, 2 McChickens Plain, 10 Piece Chicken McNuggets, 2 Fries, and 2 Drinks.  Was asked if my order was correct on the preview screen as they were inputting the order, which isn't a slight against the venue, as I am used to this.  Got the order, pull around and parked to check, as I always do, and saw that the 2 McChickens were not plain. Pulled back around through the drive through to get replacements.  After I reached the second window, and returned the 2 McChickens, the staff spent almost 2 minutes arguing among themselves in Spanish (I assume in an attempt to conceal the conversation from the customer, but being one who can speak enough Spanish to understand I would have advised them that th best way to hide the conversation would have just been to not have the conversation in front of a customer). The drive through staff was accusing the person on the food line for the mistake, and the food line staff member was arguing back that the drive through staff didn't take my order correctly.  After those 2 minutes, they asked to see my receipt, which sadly showed that the McChicken was not marked to be plain. A win for the food line staff person, but not helping the customer service points much. They asked me to pull around and park in front and they would bring the corrected items to me. I left the copy of the receipt they asked for with them.  I pulled around front, and waiting a full ten minutes! Just as I had made the decision to get out of the car and check, they brought out my entire order, remade, minus the drinks! I was surprised because I still had the rest of the food for my order. On the one hand, it was nice because of the wait I didn't have to worry about cold food. Sadly, on the down side, it took them ten minutes, which I feel is unacceptable. Also, now both of the McChickens AND the McDoubles were not plain.  I actually went into the venue with wrong items, and set them on the counter. I was ignored for a full 2 minutes by the entire staff, including the staff who I had previously encountered. It was very plain by the looks on their face when I made direct eye contact with them that they were thinking ""Oh great, he's back. I don't want to deal with this.""  Finally someone asked me what was wrong, and I explained that now that 4 items, not two, were not plain, and my food was now cold. The first reply, even before the staff took the food, was ""Well your receipt didn't say you wanted them plain."" That statement is the reason for the low review. I can deal with wrong orders, and a wait. My pet peeve is when someone in customer services instantly goes on the defense and tries to blame the customer.  I calmly explained that: my receipt DID show I wanted the McDoubles plain and they still had the copy of the receipt, so there was no reason to mess up the McDoubles; that while my receipt didn't show the McChickens were to be plain, me driving around and asking for them plain ment that I did want them plain; and lastly that what ever the circumstances, they had a customer who did not have the food he wanted, and they had offered to fix the situation, and they had yet to do that. Finally, the food was remade correctly, and I left.  Just another example of poor customer service. Again, I can understand and work with wrong orders, but when you let customer service slack this much, unacceptable. This would have been a one star review, but I'm giving the venue and staff the benefit of the doubt and am assuming that they remade my entire order because they considered it would be nice to replace my cold food with warm food.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-sacramento-18?osq=McDonald%27s&start=20224,5,10/16/15,1,Worst service I've ever experienced.

Commonly found in POULTRY!!!! And likely to have gotten it from the meat that had been sitting out!!!

I have proof I was here on that day and time I said (on my bank statement! Also have a text where I pinpointed my location! I would not be here talking about embarrassing personal things if it was something else!) campylobacter is also a harder bacteria to note for restaurants since it depends on the person, and they usually only occur in isolated events, not outbreaks). I had already had a cold so my immune system was compromised! My stomach is also very sensitive! PLEASE BE WARNED!! And please report if you experience similar symptoms after eating here. I begged corporate to look into this location because I do NOT want other people to get sick how I did. It is misery!!!!! I am still going through it! I lost a whole day of pay from my job because of this!! It is very serious and patrons have a right to know!

I asked for a peach and creme pie and she heard cookies and cream shake lol.. no biggie I corrected her again.  This was slowly turning to a strike as I tried to wait patiently. Finally she repeated my order and I told her it was all correct except I wanted my wrap without the meal. I thought this would be a simple request but sadly she did not know how to do that either... grrr. Once again she had to grab her manager's attention to assist her. I hid my frustration pretty well and thanked them both for their troubles and grabbed my number and sat down.   The food came quick.. they really uphold the fast food name! Took less than two minutes from my sense of time. I had my chicken wrap and pie nearly finished then I decided to take a look at my receipt. Oh no... as I looked at it, I saw she didn't completely void the meal. I was charged a soda cup when I don't drink soda.  I went back and showed her my receipt and let her know I was charged for a medium drink but never received one in the first place.  She asked if I still want it. I thought to myself I don't drink soda but I'll just fill it with water. So when I take the cup to the fountain machine. I was beyond disappointed to find there isn't a spout for water. :'(   Sadly this is by far my most disappointing visit. I did not wish to rate this low but from this visit I felt this is what was appropriate.  I hope my next visit will change my opinion.

And then your American Cheese slices that although will more than likely be the last thing standing along with the cockroach in the event of a nuclear blast, but I love your cheese...LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!  It melts ever so perfectly and covers my burger patties enveloping them in creamy, greasy, cheesy goodness..... The minced, re-hydrated onion pieces truly make the experience even more gratifying for me as does the ketchup and mustard OH and your pickles too as long as you don't add to many......   Then, you always give me as many ketchup and mayonnaise packets as I request without bitching or complaining about it OR charging me for them like some locations try to do, even if you do wonder what in the hell I am doing with them all...... For the record Micky, I'm actually using damn near every single one of them as I remove 3 of the four buns, chuck them and make a quadruple decker cheeseburger out of the meal and with each bite; I dredge all that meaty, cheesy, fatty goodness through my mini mountain of ketchup and mayonnaise concoction right before it slams into my pie hole........   $1 LARGE SODAS: Ahhhhhhh..... Icy crisp, carbonated and so far, never flat.....For several years now and right around the turn of the economy taking a dive you had the genius idea to sell your 32oz soda's for a single buck.... I gained an entirely new level of respect for you at that time and your holding firm to it even years later.... AND when I ask you for 'light on the ice' to date you have always given me what I asked for not a cup full of ice and a splash of diet Coke...   SAUSAGE McMUFFINS 2/$3..... Yet again.... With times being tough and us working people pinching our pennies you have for several years now sold these little beauties that are chocked full of some of the most flavorfully, sausagey meaty, greasy, peppery (and yes... I have dissected them in private in an attempt to crack your secret recipe code and I know you put the beloved red chili pepper flakes in them ;) good form...), salty goodness along with one hell of a perfectly cooked egg; yolk included...

Both your drive thru and dine in employees have to date, always been courteous, friendly, clean and quick as a whip when getting me and at times, me and mine back out on the road lickety split; again... unlike other locations which seriously drag ass and you don't.... AND your decision to remodel the entire interior of your pad was a magnificent decision as it's so posh and designer now even though your a Micky D's you can still reign over the others who choose to do less......

I know that this isn't the best place to go for customer service but I have never seen such terrible service in my life. Please read my story for the full detail of my experience.  I first entered to an elderly man standing near the counter talking to himself with books and no way in his hands, quite a normal scene until I realized he was trying to talk to the cashier or any employee to try to mark an order. I then stood at the counter and waited. And I waited, and well I waited some more. After about 3 or 4 min I locked eyes with an employee and she said ""ill be with you in a second"" and I responded ""alright cool"" and returned to waiting (the old man still waiting) about another 5 min a different younger woman came to the register and I said ""hey someone who can help me"" and she mumbled something unintelligable and pointed to the woman I first locked eyes with a walked away. So I waited......... Again. Another several minutes went by and I finally was serviced by an older white woman named Latisha or Latasha who did not apologize or even acknowledge my wait time. My order was quickly taken and when I went to wait there was a line of 3 or 4 other people and backing it up was the old man from the start. When the old man got the the front of the line the cashier just walked away. I quickly received my order and began to walk away to turn my back on this horrible experience when I noticed the old man still waiting $20 bill in hand. I told the cashier who had walked away that this man needed to be serviced now he has been waiting.

While I was waiting for my refund I stood there and observed her help the next customer. She forgot to pull the women's change out. Then told the women she had to wait for the manager to come by. Then because the women was lost at the fact this worker was not going to make it a priority the cashier had the nerve to actually say move out of the way. The manager finally came and as I stood there watching the manager write on my receipt she told the cashier to keep taking orders till she was done. The cashier then turned to the next customer who happen to be a well behaved preteen and said WHAT. The girl ordered and even said thank you. The manager ignored the situation thrusted my change at me and the money to the other women. They then forgot to give me the nuggets I ordered. Not once thru the whole process did I get an apology. I do not understand how they can have someone on the cashier who looks grumpy and is rude to the customers.

When their nephew asked for applications for them he was told by the woman behind the counter that it would be ""$20.00 per application."" As you can imagine he was rather surprised that a multi-million dollar corporation would be charging money for applications. I was surprised too. So I called them and the person that answered said: ""We don't charge for applications. I don't know why they would have been trying to get money for applications. But we don't do that here."" So. Now that we got to the bottom of that I was satisfied that we solved the ""pay for apps"" situation. As for service in this facility? It really is atrocious. The tables are always greasy, the floors are sticky and someone needs to go through the jungle gym with a steam washer.  @Kris M. this really is a policy of McDonald's to give you as little ketchup, pepper, salt and other sauces as possible. Say you order a 10 piece order of chicken nuggets. They will only give you 2 containers of sauce.

The management does not provide adequate training for its new hires, they expect them to tolerate very abusive behavior from customers, and they also provide inadequate feedback on how new staff are progressing. It's not uncommon for a new hire to be told, ""Relax; you're doing fine!;"" then, a few hours later, the supervisor is told to fire them. It's OK to terminate someone for cause if they consistently mess up after enough training and time on the job to actually learn the duties and responsibilities, but most new hires are young people who have no prior experience and it's a given that they'll need some some time to adapt.

Note: McD's has the BEST Coca-Cola that you can't get anywhere else!  What do they put in there? *wink wink*",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-sacramento-9?osq=McDonald%27s&start=20493,11,5/23/11,1,"Worst mcd ever! Fries are never fresh! Same with the nuggets! The fries are never golden crispy, it's all soggy and burnt, they never change the oil for the fries. They charge for ranch, BBQ, ss and everything else for 50cent that's just crazy. The walk in is so dirty and they never have lids and the drinks are always out and taste like water, beer put together. My girlfriend said that the restroom is terrible, how it stinks like sewer.

I over heard her communications with previous customers and the only word to describe her is RUDE! It was then my turn and she gave me the longest glare without saying anything. I get that customer service is hard, working at McDonald's is stressful and not all customers are nice, but her attitude towards literally everyone in the store was disappointing to me, not everyone is going to give her a hard time and she acted as if anyone even bothered to ask for some sauce or something that she might just blow up at someone, very intimidating and NOT FRIENDLY! When I went up she didn't not greet me, didn't say a word, just stared at me. So I said ""hello, I'd like etc"" (I had an easy order, only got a burrito) and she said ""we don't have that"" and I ordered one this morning. So I kinda paused for a second and asked as nicely as I could ""I think it's the sausage burrito breakfast thing"" she said ""oh"" and rolled her eyes. Then said nothing and pointed at the pin pad. It wasn't a horrible communication but she was sooooooo rude to the previous customer saying ""what do you want"", ""sauce!?"", ""pay"". Only words she'd said to that customer all while being very monotone and FULL of attitude. I'm not sure what caused her to be so sour today, hope she has a better day tomorrow and learns not to let one customer affect her service to EVERYONE.

I had just visited the farmer's market in the nearby parking lot with my toddler in tow. I had a dentist appointment coming up and realized I didn't have time to go home and make breakfast. I spotted the McDonald's which had literally not a single car in the drive-thru, so I decided I'd grab breakfast for us there. I pulled up, made my order, went to the first window to pay, had a short chat about how not busy they were, drove to the second window, and was immediately told that I would need to pull to the front of the building because I had asked for the muffin toasted well. I looked behind me to see not a single car and asked, ""Even if I'm the only one in line?"" He turned to a short woman behind him, who nodded her head, so he turned back to me and said, ""Yes."" So I pulled out to the front where 3 other cars were already waiting for the same kind of reason. Ridiculous! Not a single car in the drive-thru, but you've got, now 4 cars waiting out front on the red curb or blocking other cars because there's no designated wait area. I maneuver myself around and find a spot that I can be found by whomever comes out to bring me my food. I paid at 8:07am. I waited as I watched all three cars get their food and drive off. I waited as I saw people park, go inside, and come back out with their food in hand. I waited and waited, not wanting to pull my toddler out of the car just to run inside real quick - the whole reason why I picked the drive thru anyway.   Then, some homeless guy comes and starts walking around the area. He kept stopping and banging his fists on the ground as he yelled. I locked my doors, rolled up the windows, and moved a bit further up. At this point, I started watching the clock. At 8:15, I tried calling the store because I didn't want to leave my car (especially with my child in tow) with that man in front of the doors. It rang and rang and rang and then went to a message system. I waited some more. At 8:19, I had had enough waiting. I parked the car, pulled out my toddler, ran past the angry man, and inside. I asked if my drive thru order was ready yet. Everyone looked at me like they were confused and said, ""What did you have?"" SERIOUSLY?!?!?!? So I told them what it was and the little lady asks the ""kitchen"" workers if they had that order done. The girl back there goes, ""Oh yeah, I'm working on that."" As I see her grab cheese and JUST NOW start putting the sandwiches together (I had ordered 3 sausage muffins (no egg) with extra cheese &amp; bun well toasted). So I say, ""Are you kidding me? I've been waiting out there for over 10 minutes and you haven't even started my order? There wasn't even anyone in the drive thru! This is ridiculous."" So the poor guy that was told he had to have me wait in front asked what happened quietly, so I told him and I asked who the manager was and he pointed to the little lady who kept her back to me this whoooooole time. RUDE!   So I wait for my food inside now and with attitude she turns, hands me my bag, won't make eye contact, and goes, ""I threw in a hashbrown, sorry for the wait."" She says that without any eye contact, with a monotone voice, and it was very clear it was being said begrudgingly. I was LIVID, so I just walked out. I'm now running late, so I start driving and at the stop lights, I start opening the food. Do you know what I find? COMPLETELY SOFT, BARELY WARM BUNS. THEY WERE NOT WELL DONE IN THE SLIGHTEST BIT - IN FACT, THEY SEEMED UNDERTOASTED. If I would've had the time, I would've marched back in there, demanded it to be fixed, and quite possibly a refund for that insane amount of shenanigans. And do you know what? They cleared my order before having made it, so it LOOKS like they do great with their drive thru times. Not when you have FOUR cars waiting out front and not a single one in the drive thru. I AM SO PISSED AT THIS EXPERIENCE, MAINLY BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF CARE I RECEIVED FROM THAT SNARKY LITTLE ""MANAGER"" FOR WHAT HAPPENED.

I went to the drive thru, had 2 separate orders - one paid with cash and one was card. My first order was 6 cheeseburgers, 2 mcchickens, 20pc nuggets, a snack wrap, one large fries and a drink. I got my order in 2 bags and I realized I was missing 2 mcchickens that I paid for! I told the chick at the window I was missing my two sandwiches from the order, first she said it wasn't even on the receipt which I presented to her afterwards. Then she closed the window and another employee came with the MOST attitude saying she packed the bags herself and put the sandwiches in there. Let me remind you, I have my 2 baby girls in the backseat just trying to get some damn food. The female at the window THREW the bag of food back into my car and shut the window. We paid for our food just like everybody else so we just wanted wtf we paid for! The manager came and was not tryna hear anybody out she simply said, ""well the employee said she put it in there so you guys can either leave or we can refund you."" So we pulled to the front to get our refund, the manager asked if we wanted it all back on my card and we said no we paid 2 ways and want it back the same way. She came back with our receipts and said she put it all back on the card and that she will not help us any further. Management is horrible, employees have no customer service skills, and nobody even gave the chance to hear what the hell we had to say. I didn't want to be the one to throw a scene over 2 damn mcchickens but I wasn't gonna have them accuse me or act like I lied about 2 sandwiches THAT I PAID FOR and did not get. The whole situation escalated when we got inside but all could've been avoided with better customer service skills. Especially that manager, I would've expected more from somebody at a higher rank!

You know, I've actually remember going to McDonald's when I was a little kid back in the 1990s, and I was felt in loved with their Happy Meals every time of every month by giving a complimentary kid's toys and goodies especially for their burger and fries too. 26 years later as of 3/20/2017, I came back to revisit, and it's my first timer by coming to this East Sacramento's location! What does McDonald's do? It's easy because they serve the customers to taste and enjoy their well known fast food goodies from Egg McMuffin, the Big Mac (their signature favorite), delicious French fries, McCafe's coffee and smoothies and many more! The atmosphere and the concept remain the same as most McDonald's has across the world, and as for this location, it is very well spaced, cleanly and neatly without any debris behind.  The employees here are doing a great job for making the customers like me a fine service! Very friendly and approachable! No cons!  Now onto something interestingly good here! I ordered one of their limited time seasonal drink of Shamrock Chocolate Chip Shake in a small sized cup. It contains the remaining amounts of Shamrock ingredients filled with blended chocolate mint pieces and milk. It concludes with a top of whipped cream with colorful green sparkles. As I drank it, that smoothie was sensational! I can feel the flavors of both Shamrock and Chocolate Chip combined into a fantastical, drinkable dessert! Blended perfectly without the remaining chunks of ice cubes. Delightful!  There's a good amount of parking spaces available, so you can park anywhere you want near or far. Also, you can enter thru the drive thru area, so you can order your meals in few minutes. Finally, you can ride a bike, walk or public transportation too without the hassles and gimmicks.

You may be ordering a carbon copy of the same assembly line ""food"" you could get anywhere else, but it's refreshing when the human being serving it expresses kindness and a personality. Those manning the drive-thru have always been quite friendly, even when lines of hangry borderline diabetics impatiently honk and rev their engines as they await their next fix.   This is also one of the cleaner McDonald's. I've been to other locations (namely the one off Alhambra) whose ""dining areas"" look like they were abandoned or turned into a makeshift homeless shelter. Here, the employees seem to at least take some pride in keeping everything clean.

I pulled up at 6:10am there card reader wasn't working (that's out of their control, I'm a reasonable person) so I went to the bank across the street and came back. I specifically ordered a sausage, egg and cheese mcgriddle and 2 mcmufins. My order came out to be $7 and some change. I gave her $20 and she gave me $6.98 back. As soon as I pulled up to the food window, I realized and notified her co worker. She takes awhile and comes back saying the girl at the register gave me the right change. Meaning, the girl handling money truly believed  $20-$7 = $6. I worked at KFC in high school and they had minimal requirements; know common sense and take/give exact change. If it were a couple cents or even a dollar I probably wouldn't have noticed or really cared to be honest.

I had three orders... first one was a double cheeseburger and a mchicken.. 2nd order was a frappe no whip a double and two pies. I asked what toy they had because been on the hunt for jack jack. Guy at register said he had it so got a happy meal even though I wasn't going to but what the hell.. plus a 4 piece strips and two parfaits. The guy tells me they only have one. Okay?  So everyone is running around with their heads cut off like chickens and looking at customers like deer's in headlights. the people ahead of me complained because they messed up their order. As they asked for their missing apple pies (among other things) they were  told they only had one left. Wait what???  I asked the girl that I ordered 2 apple pies. She asked if I wanted to wait 12 minutes for the next batch?? okay??? so you don't have parfaits and now you don't have apple pies? I said no and wanted my money back. no apologies.   side note: apple pies are the easiest thing to make there. If you realize you are down then the manager (ERIKA) should have asked someone to make more and while at it some parfaits.  Ok got my first order. My frappe without whip cream came with whip cream.

Was Ronald McDonald off scaring little kids instead of manning the fryer, what's up? Chicken was so bad everyone just said no thanks and we actually ate my friends food we NEVER eat! Yes... you heard that right, we rather eat a friends food who cooks like Guy Fieti eats... messy. Instead of calling them doing the yell at the manager over some chicken wings thing I try to be professional and email their corporate office and get a phone call from the manager at the store, email from customer service, and another email apologizing for the product. They tell me they put me on ""the list"" which tells the employees I get free food. I feel so special, although something told me this fast food VIP list was probably still not going to end well somehow. But I give them ANOTHER chance since well.. I'm cheap and thought hey free wings why not, although once a place burns me this bad (no pun intended) I usually just avoid like most people avoid South Sacramento. So I go through the drive thru and tell them that my name is on the ""list"" and she takes 5 minutes trying to figure out if it is or not. I got 4 cars behind me getting mad, a friend in the car telling me they told me not to give them another chance, a prostitute in the parking lot showing her breasts to guys, and a inept worker who finally tells me that my name is on the list but they have me picking up said wings and the manager signed off. I tell them I did not pick them up and she says yes you did. Wait......... what?! I did?! Was it my bizarro alter ego again? I shake my head and tell her I have not came back since the failed Chernobyl wings and she swears I did.I tell her they should check the tape in frustration but if they don't have a grease thermometer or timer to tell you when to take out wings before they become nuclear then sure they don't have that so I tell her forget it and made to feel like somehow I AM the guilty one holding everyone up and trying to score double free wings.  Overall, McDonalds stick to burgers and leave the chicken alone. Also, when service and product is THIS bad you do NOT EVER EVER EVER go back and I didn't listen to myself or my friends. Management screwed the pooch TWICE on this and don't think all the promises of free food is going to ever get me to come back so they have lost a customer.

By the way, there is a Chevron near there. Don't go to it. Their gas is about 50 cents more than the other stations around. Back to McDonalds. It is also really clean.

I ordered the 10 piece McNugget meal. I got 10 chicken tenders, no meal so not even close. Minus 1 star. Secondly, the tenders I did not order were completely gristle and gross. So had I ordered them, or anyone else, they would have been disappointed. Minus 1 star. Thirdly, and the reason I didn't complain about getting my order wrong, the person in front of me got their order wrong too. When they tried to tell the cashier about it he just stared and nothing was ever corrected. So no customer service. Minus 1 star. And lastly, the place was full of flies. They were everywhere.

I'm not one to complain about the line though because I've worked in customer service before. Usually my visits are great here, BUT tonight's experience was terrible! The guy at the first window was extremely rude! I don't know if this employee was having a bad day or what, but he was rude when we ordered. At first I ordered two large fries, a lemonade drink, and a 10 piece chicken nugget. Our total came up to like $13 let's say. So my cousin and I wanted to pay for our own items and ask if we could pay $3 in cash and the rest on the debit card. First he said okay, but then he handed us the money 10 seconds later saying that he can't do that because we could cone him. Because supposedly that's what happened to him the last time he did something like that. We were fine with it and paid with the debit card and got our food at the second window. I got half way home and decided to check if I got everything, but nope I didn't receive 2 large fries, but only one. So I had to turn back around to purchase another large fries because the guy didn't charge me for it. The second time at the window he was still rude as before. When he handed me back my change he folded the money....like why did he do that? Keep in mind that these two visits I was being soo kind and using good manners saying please and thank you. I got home and the BOTH of the fries are crap. They taste straight up like ass. They were cold and not chewable at all. Also, the saddest part was they weren't salty at all and if you know McDonald's fries you know that they are always salty asf unless you ask them to freshly make yours. I called the same location and asked for the guy's name at the window JUST FOR THIS REVIEW. HIS NAME IS JOSEPH.

I also wanted to give them the benefit of doubt. What a very disappointing experience two days in a row.   The drivethru still took forever to respond.

When I was like hello? This dumbass fool gonna say oh you weren't finished? Like wow... and you are who?   So I pull up and I asked him straight up are you going to compensate for the long wait and terrible service you have? He goes nope because there is only 2 people working. Now... what kind of structure do you have? Maybe, just freakin maybe, you should stop trying to hire so many of these young kids who obviously cannot work past 10pm to help you work the late shift. Or.. maybe you should restruct your staff better.  Someone had sent me a message pertaining to the location and how ghetto the workers are. Now I'm not trying to be judgmental so I won't consider that. However, what I'm going to say is... poor staff and customer service highly reflects on the training team, hiring managers, managers and the company itself. Obviously customer service is not as important as money therefore the way this particular store is structure is terrible. Yes I'm going to blame management, I don't give a damn what other priority you may have. If I was managing this branch I'd put the whole damn staff in check on what customer service is and why you should seriously do your job like you are supposed to.

Not only did he not understand the machine, he didn't know the menu. I finally figured out where to look for nugget meal and tried to pay with my card. The card reader has a sign that says ""scan"" card. To me, that means swipe. But to them it means insert. Why don't they just have a sign that says ""insert card""? Paying cash is a two step process that will require to go to the counter after using the kiosk. And if you get a drink, you'll have to find a worker to get your cup.   As you can see, the new system is slow, cumbersome, and stupid. McDonalds is trying to save money by replacing humans with machines, but what's the point if you still need a human to work the machine, or go to the counter to either pay or get a cup? This is a big fail for McDonalds.  Regarding the food, on my most recent visit, I ordered from the kiosk and specified light salt on my fries. It's nice that you have that option. However, they pretty much ignored the request and gave me cold salty fries instead. The chicken nuggets were also lukewarm.

I order breakfast from McDonald's maybe once a month or so and I have never had any problems. The morning people tend to be quite friendly and are fast when it comes to giving their customers food.  For the most part however, I go to McDonald's for dinner more often than I do in the morning. I also want to mention that majority of the time that I go there I dine in. Recently they remodeled this location and have added electronic kiosks so that the customer can order their food from there. In addition they added new floors as well as tables and chairs.   Now I know that this may seem like a good thing, but ever since they remodeled I feel as if their staff especially those who work in the afternoon or late at night have gotten careless. For one thing the kiosks are a bit tedious. For example, if you want to use a coupon or pay with cash you need to go over to an employee so they can ring you up the normal way. Also if you have ordered a drink, you need an employee to provide you with cups.  Since this location has remodeled you would think that the employees would want to keep it looking nice and clean for their customers. Well to be completely honest they haven't been doing that at all. I went in today to order dinner which I did from the kiosk and got a cup from an employee. Then I went over to the soda machines and I noticed that the floor around the machines as well as the counter top was very dirty and sticky. Since they have kiosks at this location shouldn't that mean that there are more employees that are available that can clean? After getting my soda I went to sit in one of the booths, but they were all dirty with crumbs on the table tops. I looked at the other tables and they were the same way. I know a dirty table isn't that big of a deal, however I shouldn't have to clean it off myself because I am not an employee. Therefore I went up to the register and asked if they could clean the table off for me. The lady I asked then asked her co-worker to get someone to do it. Immediately I thought that she should've been the one to do it because she wasn't doing anything in the first place. I waited a few minutes and saw that they told an older female employee to do the cleaning. That to me seems somewhat rude. That gives me the impression that none of the young adults wanted to clean and the older employee was stuck with the task.  All of these things combined just makes me as a customer, unsatisfied with their customer service they provide.

And as a huge MickeyD's fan, believe me, I've been to a lot of them.  Why this one is my favorite: - The best kid's play area around. It's relatively clean. There is a door to the kids' area, so unless an older child or adult opens it, my kid cannot get out. There is also a family bathroom IN the play room, so you can leave your kids to play and use the restroom quickly. It's also great to change a diaper, or let little ones go to the bathroom alone. - They have the good soda machines, with a million different flavor combos - The employees are nice, and are especially accommodating for those with kids. They often carry my tray to the kid's room, since my hands are already full - Food is regular MickeyD's food. If you like it, then it's the same here, fine. - It's clean. The tables are always clean, even in the kids' room.  My only complaint: - The temperature in the play room. Sometimes it's freezing and sometimes it's unbearably hot, but it's never comfortable.

So there are actually two McDonald's within this parking lot (one at the Chevron gas station and one inside the Wal-Mart Supercenter).  As you can see by the title of this business listing, I am speciflcally reviewing the one inside the Wal-Mart Supercenter.  I am from the Department of Redundancy Department.  Was hella hungry around 9:30pm and Perseus had to gas up at the Chevron.  Since that McDonald's was still open, my complaining gastro-intestinal tract led me towards the golden arches.  However, per Perseus' recommendation, we headed to Wal-Mart because he needed some cereal.  May I remind the readers that sales tax in Stockton has now increased from 7.75% to 8.00%.  8.00% is significantly less than the 8.5% Sales Tax in San Francisco, and relatively less than the 8.25% Sales Tax in Daly City.  Bottomline: you will not be raped as much with Sales Tax when you buy your cereals in Stockton.  So he goes off to buy his cereals and I go to the McDonald's inside the Wal-Mart Supercenter.  It is located on the left side, if you are facing the Midnight Mall from the outside.  They didn't have the grilled chicken snack wrap (only had crispy kind), so I opted for the cheapie $1 bacon cheeseburger, a soft-serve vanilla cone, and a small fries... for $3 and change.  Once I got my food, I proceeded to a relatively clean table, as most were trashed due to the lackadaisical ways of the customers and/or employees.  I felt up my burger, which was seemingly hella thin.  I thought, ""dang, the burgers are getting smaller and smaller by the day.""  I opened it up and, lo and behold, the burger patty was not in the sandwich.  All I got was some bacon, pickles, ketchup, and mustard.  I brought it back and the cash register lady apologized, then proceeded on mocking the sous chefs in the back for fucking up my burger.  (Bad move.... don't scold the sous chef in front of the customer!  Just apologize, make me a new burger, and let's move on.)  While waiting for my replacement burger, my fries got cold.  I enhanced the fries by eating them with the soft serve vanilla.      This McDonald's does not have a ""Playland"" section, but they have puzzles and little wall-mounted trinkets for little children to play with in the back.  If you are a parent and have children, please be cautious about your children's involvement with these mounted puzzles/trinkets.  They are teeming with bacteria, so please keep a close eye on your children if they decide to put their mouths on those things.  (this is USEFUL).

I recommend taking your food home to avoid the inevitable McD's crowd and homeless people. The restaurant is pretty big inside and usually pretty clean, but certainly not better than your own couch. Or if it is, I feel bad for you.

It's hard to really write a review about a fast food chains food because its all the same: however, you can definitely review the service of a specific location. This review is about the poor service at this particular location.  I used the drive thru late the other night and ordered two McChickens and a Pumpkin Pie for $1.00 (not the 2 for $1.00 deal)...so it was a very VERY simple order. And you would think, ""They can't possibly get this order wrong, right?"" WRONG! SO WRONG!  I should have know my order was going to be wrong when I approached the service window and the guy working the window asked if I order two Sweet Teas (he had drinks in hand) and I said, ""that's not my order."" When I finally received my order, I checked my order before driving off, and it looked correct. MISTAKE: I didn't check the pie because it was in a ""pumpkin pie"" box so you automatically think the pie MUST be in there right? WRONG AGAIN. SO WRONG!   When I got home a few minutes later and finished my McChickens...I was excited to try the new Pumpkin Pie, which came in a brown/orangish box, but it wasn't a pumpkin pie. Nope...it was an Apple Pie. WTH? I told you it was WRONG...SO SO WRONG.  How do you get a simple order like that mixed up? I can't even imagine ordering like $15 worth of food at this location. Do you know how messed up that order would be? The only word that comes to mind is...WRONG! SO WRONG!  Try another McDonald's location and skip this place.

Today I left the K street McDonalds feeling as if some wrongs were righted in the world after going to the Broadway McDonalds and discovering that they provided me with a bowl of a few oats coupled with a copious amount of hot water. I am not a fan of returning food because I do not want anything extra in my meal but I decided to go to a different location to air my grievances.   Pros: Gloria, the morning manager, gave me no quarrels with replacing the oatmeal although we know each McDonalds is for the most part separately owned.

Which is not good (because fast food). But I decided to stop by for a quick lunch around 12pm on a Thursday. After looking through the app, I saw a BOGO deal on their new Chicken Tenders along with a BOGO deal on any size French Fries. So that's exactly what I went with! They had 2 types of chicken tenders, Buttermilk Chicken Tenders and Sweet N Spicy Honey BBQ Glazed Tenders, so I got one of each. I also got some Mac Sauce on the side which was a good move! Each one costs around a little less than $5. I also got a Small Fries (~$2) and a free one! In total, this meal cost me less than $7 which is great. The only caveat with using the app is you can only redeem one coupon at a time, so I had to do this as two separate transactions, according to the worker. The tenders were a good try and were pretty good, but I don't think I would get them again. The fries were solid, as usual!

""They're people like we're people, so they shouldn't be discriminated against,"" said Constance Gastinell who works with developmentally disabled adults through programs that help integrate them into the community.  Gastinell sometimes takes some of the adults to a McDonald's on Elk Grove Boulevard for lunch, but the last time they were there she says the owner kicked them out. ""He came in and he said, 'well you guys, you can't eat here, you have to leave.'""  She said the owner told her they couldn't stay because they were conducting 'business.'  ""We weren't conducting business. We came into eat. We had no paperwork; we had money to buy,"" said Gastinell.  But McDonalds says there was no discrimination. In a statement issued to News10, Dennis and Vicki Caldwell, the local owners of the restaurant, said, This recent situation involved a food fight within their group, and disruption to our other guests.  The Caldwells added it wasn't the first time such an incident has occurred.  We have consistently attempted to work with these guests and accommodate their needs as best we can, their statement read.  Gastinell says there was no food fight and her group was well behaved.  ""We went in to eat. We weren't disruptive,"" she said.  She feels they were told to leave because they were mentally disabled.  ""I did feel as though they were targeting us, although he [the owner] says that he wasn't. Being kicked out, how else are you supposed to feel?"" Gastinell said.  Soon after she was asked to leave, she rounded up her clients and left. She wants others to understand the stigma that surrounds people with disabilities.  ""When you see them hurt, it hurts you. That's why it's personal,"" said Gastinell.  While Gastinell says she will continue to defend her clients, she no longer plans on going to the Elk Grove restaurant.  News10/KXTV  - Having a mentally disabled daughter, Kathryn (pictured), this story drove me out of my mind. People have no idea how hard it is, just to go out to a store or restaurant or anywhere. We get the stares and the looks, sometimes from children, more often from adults. We've all seen the group of four or five disabled folks being assisted by a health care worker, going around a store to get some things or sitting at your local restaurant, just wanting to be like everyone else. I wish Elk Grove were closer, I'd like to chat with their manager. I hope ""big"" McDonalds is paying attention to this particular franchise, as how individual restaurants and employees treat guests is a direct reflection of the organization as a whole.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-elk-grove-7?osq=McDonald%27s&start=801345,28,11/18/16,1,"McDonald's are no longer really kid friendly. The people here are rude. They don't have paper towels in the bathroom to dry hands.

It isn't a secluded drive thru where you have to stay in that line, because it's just a lane that wraps around the back of the building... so if you change your mind and don't feel like getting fat today, you can easily turn out of the lane and get on your way to the gym!

This particular McDonalds' drive thru is terrible.  Some of the workers are nice and know what they are doing, but some are just incompetent and so slow.  First off, if you drive up to one of the two drive up speakers first, it doesn't guarantee that your order will be taken first.  Once they take your order, they may or may not have what you want (i.e. they may not be able to make an Egg McMuffin because they are out of eggs... the coffee machine is broken so they are only serving cold drinks...).  Once you get to the window, they usually ask you what you have ordered and then will scramble to just then start making your coffee drink.  If you order something with specific requests like an Egg McMuffin without ham, you may end up with an Egg McMuffin with ham and no cheese.  So... yeah... this McDonalds is not good.  While it is on the way to my daughter's school and is a more convenient location, after so many inconsistencies, I will go out of my way to go to the McDonalds on Northgate because their drive thru is soooo much better.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-sacramento-12?osq=McDonald%27s&start=601496,30,1/20/17,4,"Stopped by here to grab something to eat. It was packed around 4:45pm on a Friday. I originally ordered the Artisan Grilled Chicken, and the cashier talked me into bumping it up into a meal to save me money. I gave in even though I really didn't want a bigger size fries other than a small, nor did I want a drink. My total came to $10.26. I sat down to wait for my number to be called and thought how ridiculous the amount was for 2 things I technically didn't want and a damn chicken sandwich. I'm ballin' on a budget and trying to lose weight, so more fries PLUS a soda just wasn't necessary. Now, I hate being difficult at a restaurant because I know how it feels on the receiving end but I just couldn't justify spending well over $6 on a meal at McDonald's. Needless to say; I went up to the counter and stopped Latesha to cancel my order ASAP so as not to have the food made and potentially wasted. It was swamped in there and I could see how fast everyone was moving and I could feel the chaotic energy. But Latesha remained calm and polite, and got it done. I didn't have to stand in line again. She ran back to cancel the meal, came and asked if I would like something else. I gave her my new, smaller and obviously cheaper order, and she came back with the exact amount of change and a smile. A few minutes later, she had my meal ready and I was on my way home. I told her to have her boss check these reviews so he/she would know that she handled business, and remained cool amidst the craziness and my inconvenient ordeal. I placed a second order for another hamburger for my friend and the cashier, who was new, short changed me by a nickel. But I let it go when I realized after the drawer closed just because I didn't want to be more difficult. Maybe her drawer might be short tonight and my 5 cents made all the difference. Also; prior to this, the moment I walked in - said cashier and Latesha were dealing with an angry customer - and neither of them let it affect their positive attitudes.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-sacramento-12?osq=McDonald%27s&start=601497,30,4/10/15,1,"I wish I could give this McDonald's a zero but yelp won't allow that!

At the drive thru, I practically repeated my self 5 times. I told the lady we wanted a club chicken sandwich meal with no cheese ( #11). We also ordered a #3 meal and 1 apple pie.   Right after we had paid, the lady told me to park my car and wait outside in the front. "" Park your car and wait in the front."" I asked what do you mean? Do you want me to get out of the drive though? She looked at me with contempt and said ""yea"".   So I pull out of the drive though, and waited. It looked like they where kind of busy so I could understand why they told me to do this, however getting out of the drive though was a first for me. In addition, her rudeness was unnecessary.   After about 5 minutes another lady pops out with a bag of food, I waved to her and she came. She looked angry  for some reason. I asked her if this was #3 meal and #11 with 1 apple pie. She said "" its what ever you ordered, your orders in this bag"". After handing it to me, she went inside, no apology for the wait.  We received the following - Club chicken sandwich, 1 medium fries ( we ordered large) and the 1 soda we original got after paying in the drive though. There was a #3 sandwich, no soda and no fries. NO APPLE PIE.   So I get out of my car, go inside and explain to them what I got. They scrambled around asking each other if they had put an apple pie in the bag. After another 2 minutes of waiting, It turns out no one knew if an apple pie went in the bag. She gives me the apple pie but then explains that since I only paid for a sandwich I would only get a sandwich. No apology was given, excess time was wasted and they where beyond rude.  I understand they might have been tired, and busy. But why are you taking your anger out on me, especially when it was your fault to begin with.

Let me tell you.  I use to visit this location very often. Actually I probably spent an average of 60.00-80.00 dollars a week here until I just could not stand the poor customer service anymore. Let me explain.  I typically like to buy a 20 Chicken nuggets along with a burger or fries or a drink for myself. Typically my bill would be about 10.00 on up depending on if I was buying just for me or others.   The Elkhorn Mc D's generally is good, well average. I've had better and I've had worse. The problem I constantly have though is a simple request. That request is that I get 4 packs of sauce typically sweet and sour with my order instead of the 3 they want to give you to save costs for a 20 piece order. Now everyone knows  packet of sauce lasts for about 5 nuggets. So why Mc D's tries to cut costs and give only three packs is just wrong, it's bad customer service. But I understand cutting costs.   However what I don't understand is why even after asking for that extra packet, sometimes even being charged extra for it! Even though Mc D's even says the first one is free. What I don't understand is why I rarely get it with my order? I even made the effort to make sure it's clear being very polite that I want 4 sauces even having the order taker put the extra one on the order screen but when it's time to get my food the extra sauce is not there. Now after many, many times of this and trying many things to make sure I get it which to be honest is a real pain in the ass rather then just getting 4 sauces for all order automatically instead of 3 which is clearly not enough.   So how does a Sweet and Sour sauce cost 3120.00 or more? Well after literally years of playing this sick game and coming out the loser more often then a happy customer. I just stop going here as often as I once did. As a matter of fact I rarely go here now and stopped getting the 20 piece Chicken Mc nuggets so that I don't have to hassle with a order being wrong. Until today. Yes today the drive thru was empty and I was hungry. Instead of walking in to Food Source which is in the same parking lot to get a fully roasted Chicken, a soda and some chips for less than the cost of a 20 piece nuggets and 2 cheese burgers. I made the mistake of going to McDonalds. Well guess what I ordered 4 packs of sweet and sour and went to get my order and forgot to check my bag to make sure my order was correct (something a customer should not have to do!) When I left and was looking forward to eating food I've avoided now for about a year or more I was very disappointed again to see I was shorted my sauce. Now I know a sauce may seem like a small thing to stop doing business with a company for. But after awhile of regular poor customer service it's a sign the management and people don't really care about the customer experience in my opinion and experience and it's time to find other places to do business with. And that is exactly what I did! I took my 10.00 or more per visit 3-6 days a week, a average of 60.00 a week, to the competition. Now if you multiply 60.00 a week x 52 weeks a year what did that Sweet and Sour sauce cost Mc Donald's easily 3,120.00 a year!   Now I can't be the only person this happens to who has had enough of this poor business practice to short customers of their order's so the loss probably is more since I am sure other's who've had enough also found better places to spend their money.   I just hope Mc D's reconsiders this practice and give 1 sauce for ever 5 nuggets like they do on say a 10 piece order by itself. Why do they give 2 sauces on a 10 piece but only 3 on a more expensive 20 piece order? Stop with cutting corners and just give the customer a great experience it's not that hard. I hope ownership and management really figure out a way to solve this problem. Until then it will be at least another year until I spend my hard earned money with this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-rio-linda?osq=McDonald%27s&start=01703,34,5/24/17,2,"I've been going to this McDonalds for a long time, and I've had the few problems others have had such as a messed up order which has never been a huge deal to me, I can usually fix it on my own or get it fixed.

I did not take a picture of it because I noticed it when we were at the window and let the employee know, she got me a new one and realized her finger was cut open I saw her get a band aid there and then. My other reason happened today. I have been really sick and was really hungry so a roommate took me to get some food. I got a Big Mac, when we got home I took the pickles off like usual and noticed my patty was all kinds of torn up, like it had been thrown around. I was whatever about that thinking maybe it just got stuck to the grill. I started to eat my burger, the patty was cold but I was hungry. Then I saw a huge piece of plastic sticking out of my burger. I sat it down after that. I could not eat another bite.  I called the manager and they were nice but I feel like the employee who made the burger didn't care to make sure it was properly made and when it comes to food that scares me.

The inside is nice and clean with dark wood fixtures and flowers on the tables.  The staff is always nice, the bathrooms are clean and it's in a good neighborhood.

I am a store manager and the business will only be as good as it's staff. This locations seems like they hire anyone that walks in the door looking for a job they don't take the time to hire friendly professional employees. The drive through cashiers are the worst, mostly all night time shift cashiers they talk to you very ""ghetto"" don't even say the ""hi"" or ""welcome to McDonald's"" they mest up your orders and when you get to the window they are even more of a worst impression then when you order your food on the speaker. Management needs to hire more different races it seems lately they are hiring all the same race. They sell bad apple pies with stickers saying eat by 3pm yet it's 10pm and that's what they are putting in my bag is old tasting apple pies not even warm. The frys are old and clearly you can taste it. The waiting period is out of control at this location, drive through experience needs a lot of improvement. I would like to see better customer service and more professional employees. There is this African American guy that works the mornings on drive through giving the food and he is amazing! He's so cheerful and always says ""Good morning welcome to mcdonalds! What can I get for you on this sunny day"". He is very motivated and even though I don't know his name, he is a example of how employees should act.

I noticed there was one person before me that didn't have any problems ordering. I pulled up to the speaker and the customers order was still in plain view on the order screen. I was acknowledged immediately and they asked if I could hold for a moment. Mind you there is only one person ahead of me and it's not like there's a long line. Another vehicle pulls right on through the drive thru and didn't even stop to order and pulls up right behind the other vehicle that just ordered. I sat there for almost a good 10 minutes and didn't receive any reply back. I got tired of waiting for them to answer back. I pulled to see if I could pull ford to exit but I couldn't. The two vehicles were still in the drive thru. So in order to leave I had to back out of the drive thru.

Keep in mind however if this is why you're coming here but you must treat it as a public park there is no age restriction as the children who can play there and if you're having a problem with the activities of the children best to deal with them directly because management has nothing to do with it unless they are being hazardous to themselves or the equipment. So it does get rowdy especially after school or when its raining. As far as food 8 out of 10 times they get my order right.

The cashiers at the front are not the brightest but the drive thru ladies are much more bitchy here, I recommend save your gas and go inside.

PLEASE make some changes, McDonalds!  Of course my kids enjoy McDonald's, but in comparison this store is the worst McDonald's in Lodi. The other Lodi McDonald's stores are really rather nice. Please note... The counter and dining room employees were great! They were very nice, helpful, hard working and efficient... I appreciated that a lot! But there are other big problems with this store.   First off, this store is very small, often dirty and incredibly HOT! They do not turn on the A/C high enough (even when it's 100 degrees outside!), as they should and the result is a group of sweating customers trying to eat their food...gross! When it's too hot in there it just seems more dirty, sticky and unpleasant for the customers (and I'm sure the employees too).   This store attracts a big group of homeless people that hang out inside and around the store parking lot (loitering). I guess it's because this store is by the freeway and next to a big truck stop. It makes it very uncomfortable to eat here with my family when there are many disturbed people talking to themselves, hanging around in the bathrooms, taunting others and asking people for money. They like to hang out inside the restaurant for long periods of time. Some of these folks have been quite aggressive and threatening. It would be fine, but you cannot allow ANYONE to behave with that kind of disrespect to your customers... or employees for that matter.    We decided to leave the store early (again), as to get the kids away from the aggressive men staring and commenting at us while we were trying to eat. It was very unpleasant for my family. And it scared the kids. I'm sure the McDonald's Corporation wouldn't be happy about this sort of thing at one of their stores. Maybe they need a security guard at this McDonald's store.   I like McDonald's (and Lodi) a lot, so I hope they can get a handle on this poor situation at this Banner Street (Flag City, Lodi, CA) McDonald's store.   Keep up the good work employees...I can tell that you work hard... even though you only get minimum wage. I respect that. And to the managers (and owners)... I really think you need to step it up! I KNOW for a fact that you can do a lot better.   Managers... make sure your franchise owner knows what is going on here.   Well, we'll see how it goes the next time we're in the area. Please work on these issues, so we don't have to skip this store for a better one.   Bottom line...   - Clean the store... inside and out! - TURN UP THE A/C!!! - Run off the aggressive people that loiter inside and outside the store. - Do not allow the loitering people to be aggressive towards your customers or employees.   - Clean those bathrooms! - Appreciate your hard working employees.  - Put napkins in the dining room, as you spend too much time retrieving napkins when they are requested.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-lodi-3?osq=McDonald%27s&start=201894,37,9/1/14,1,Food was Normal for what you can find here this is mostly about the bathroom.

This was the worst McDonalds, and possibly the worst dining experience I have ever had. Let me preface this by saying I don't expect much from McDonalds to begin with - if the facility were clean, well kept, food the appropriate temperature and staff competent, then I would give a five star rating. Unfortunately,  this was not the case. We stopped here because it was the first McDonalds we had seen in 20 miles and we feared we might not see another in another 20 - sadly, after leaving we saw three more McDonalds in the next town, all would have been a better choice. We walked in and the floor looked unswept, the walls dingy and the sound of screaming children permeated the entire establishment. When asked about the menu, the staff seemed completely clueless of what the offer. The soda machines had no syrup and flies were circling the lid dispenser area. When we actually were able to muster the attention of a harried-looking worker to inform them of the fact that the machine was empty, they responded with ""oh"" and had to be prompted to actually procure a diet coke.

While waiting for my order, I scanned the area I was sitting in...there was no one else sitting in the area and there were about 20 tables.

I thought maybe they were overwhelmed serving customers....nope, hardly anyone in the joint. There were a few cars in the drive thru...but just 3 or 4. So why wasn't someone attending the needed clean up in the dining area? I can't imagine what the food prep or storage area looks like and don't want to real think about it...yuck!

This specific location has a very low rating. Most of the poor reviews are pretty accurate in my opinion. In common, they say bad and or slow service. They also say this location is dirty.

Now onto the review of this particular McD's.  I figured since I have emailed the company on numerous occasions on how good the service is here, I might as well put it up on Yelp.  I will go out of my way to go to this McDonald's because when the employees talk to you and smile, it feels sincere.  I like that, and I am sure these employees deal with quite a few jerks, at least they have on a couple of occasions when I have been there, and yet they are still friendly to each individual.  They don't take it out on the next customer.  I just love this McDonald's, the consistency of the food, freshness, and friendliness.  I do have one caveat, which almost made me give four stars, but that is my own selfishness.  This McDonald's says they serve breakfast until 10:45 am.  SO, I expect that when I show up at 10:38 am, I will still be served breakfast.  However, there seems to be a discrepancy in management and how they ""feel"".  Because on a couple of occasions they have (they actually said ""she changed it today"", which I took to mean the manager) decided to stop serving early.  Early, as in according to their posted time of 10:45 am.  That irks me.  Because I love Mc'Donald's breakfast the most, and when I have my taste buds all worked up for hashbrowns and an Egg McMuffin, trust me, fries and a cheeseburger don't cut it!  Other than that, I'd probably trade government secrets for their hashbrowns!  I LOVE MC'DONALD'S!!!!!  :)  P.S.  I miss the fried pies!  Especially the cherry!  I don't care how healthy it is or not, I know what I'm buying and eating!  Which brings me to another point...an Egg McMuffin is actually very healthy.  It is the perfect ratio of protein to fat to carbs for a meal.  :)  I take the top muffin off and smother it with pepper and ketchup.  What?  Does that negate it?  ;)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-stockton-2?osq=McDonald%27s&start=402543,50,11/17/11,3,Came here for a quick bite after getting off late.

I went inside today because the drive up line had ten cars and I knew it would be faster. I ordered two Number Twos (the two cheeseburger meal) and an al a carte cheeseburger and small fry.  The cost was over $18 which seemed pricey, but with the moving menu board I couldn't find my meal in time so I paid and began filling my drinks.  (I hate that they don't have Lemonade any longer as this limits my caffeine free choices even more).  The drink station was cluttered with straw wrappers, soiled lids (with two in the ice grate), and various other trash, liquids etc.  The ice dispenser on the right didn't work at all.    After getting my drinks I heard another customer say, ""you don't have the cheeseburger meal?""  The cashier said, ""not anymore because we added the cheeseburger to the dollar menu.""  This made me pause because I had just ordered the cheeseburger meal... I focused on the menu screen and sure enough, the Number Two was now a quarter pounder meal.  There was no sign indicating something to the effect of, ""some of your favorite menu items may have changed"" and the cashier had said nothing to me.  After the cashier was done with her customer I explained to her that I didn't know that the Number Two was no longer two cheeseburgers, to which she replies, ""yeah, we changed it last night.""  I do feel as though if you are going to make a change to something that has been that way for 25 YEARS, maybe you mention to your customers that hey, did you want the cheeseburger meal or quarter pounders? Because what the hell?  The cashier was kind enough to supply a solution and refund me the quarter pounders, charge for the cheeseburgers, and we called it good.  But it does seem odd to me that they wouldn't mention a change like that.

The person at the drive through handed me the bag and stated, ""heres your food"" no thank you no review of the order. When I had gotten home we had realized the food was very cold, the burger was black from being over cooked and the bun was stale to the point of being hard and un edible. We both threw the food away knowing we weren't going to drive 10 minutes back to this location and put up with poor service again. I had taken the survey on line indicating they can keep their 2 for one deal I wanted a refund for the food I had to throw away, I had asked for a call back from the manager, this was 4 days ago. DO NOT waste your time or your money for rude service, no respect for your time or patronage. The food was so terrible I dont see how a location could be so inconsistent when they only have one menu to practice every day. I wish I could add an image of the blackened burgers and hard buns.

Instead of making a fresh cheeseburger with more than the standard two pickles, they give me the premade leftover cheeseburgers and slap a special order sticker on it without even squeezing an extra pickle into it.

Then the boy told me to pull around front to wait for my meals. I declined politely, but he told me I had to pull around if I wanted my food because there were customers behind me. I explained it was only one car, and I ordered and paid before he did, therefore I should receive my food before he did. I mean, it's fast food, not ""fast for some people, but you have to wait"" food. I'll also add that I didn't have any special requests that would make my food take longer, so I thought I was being pretty reasonable.  He said that the man behind me needed his food and I was rude for making him wait. When I told him I would stay put, he promptly told me to return my drinks for a refund. When I was refunded, I was given almost $2 less than I had paid. I pulled around and went inside to correct it. I had my receipt that proved my payment of $25.12 and also his refund receipt that proved he had given me back $23.54, so there was no way they could dispute what I was owed. Luckily, a (MUCH NICER) employee correct the refund and apologized. As I was leaving, I could hear her telling him he could not force refund a customer. I understand it was one employee, but I refuse to ever eat at a McDonald's location again if they continue to force customers to pull around to wait for their food.

I was terribly disappointed by the bad decision I made.  The only thing premium about the premium hamburger I was served was the price.  When I was a kid, I used to eat tiny hamburgers that came in small rectangles offered by a small hamburger chain in and around Washington, DC.  I don't recall the name of this restaurant chain (White Castle?) but the hamburgers were distinctively small -- but were positively delicious.  The hamburger I was served by McDonald's reminded me of those, not because it was delicious -- this was not -- but because of its size.  It was tiny.  McDonald's should call these Hamburger McBites.  Even worse yet, it was terrible.  There is probably better roadkill out there --- better smelling, more nutritious, and far less an insult to the senses.  There was a huge gob of cold mayonnaise on one side of the sandwich, about the size of a large banana slug, predominately on the OUTSIDE of the bun and a tiny, cute little crescent of something orangish-yellow that look suspiciously like it passed for a tomato(you could probably read through it -- the whole thing bearing absolutely no resemblance to the photos they have of the premium sandwich you're supposed to be offered.  I won't tell you what this smelled like.  Worse yet, the bun was actually soggy and the dark meat-substance that looked remarkably like a tiny rubber hamburger patty was actually cold to touch, and I made this observation not more than a minute after we left the drive-through serving line.  This is about the lowest of the low experiences I've had at McDonald's.  I was so insulted, I got out of my car, went into the ""restaurant"" and dropped this latest insult du jour on the register counter so that employees and customers could see for themselves what they were passing off on people as food.  Their WiFi wasn't working so I couldn't use it to express my indignation to McDonald's corporate headquarters, home of the original ""We don't care: we don't have to"" attitude that Mickey D's is now famous for.  Some officious little snot of a manager cloyingly asked me what I wanted to do about this insult I just was subjected to.  I'm not sure that suggesting they use it as they would a suppository would have shocked them to objectively see for themselves what an insult their 'food' has become.  I suggested that she put it in a biohazard disposal bag and bury it, loudly enough for everyone in the restaurant to hear.  (After all, they should be warned, too.)  It would have been a fitting end for what they are sneaking into bags and giving to their unsuspecting customers.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-modesto-7?osq=McDonald%27s&start=202981,60,3/19/15,1,"This McDonalds is literally the definition of incompetent and moronic.

When you stop and think about it. Company's  like McDonald's are pathetic. They are filled with such greed that they place a low value on man kind. They want to keep people that work for them at poverty wages in order to have record  profits.  All the while McDonald  Ceo's and corporate gooroos pull in multimillion-dollar salaries.  One this is for sure for all you McDonald corporate bigwigs.

(a meal. and a smoothie) I get to the window get the smoothie.. the bag with my meal. when I asked the curly headed kid where my drink was he said I didn't ask for 1... . this is the first time I get told the meal doesn't come w a drink. I tried to clear up to see if maybe they thought I wanted the smoothie. he rudely said no.. I told him he owed me a drink and he said nope unless I paid for it...i waa in a hurry didn't want to argue w the kid. so I left.  I tried calling shortly after to talk to the manager.  2 hrs later I'm still getting a message machine!

I was charged for the #3,egg white delight meal, and drove all the way home to pull out from the bag a sausage mcmuffin with egg. Needless to say I drove back to get the correct thing. It's the point!!!!! In addition, I choose to walk in to settle this matter as I started to go thru drive in and we were sitting for 5 minutes and the line of cars weren't moving. When I walked in, several staff members were speaking Spanish amongst themselves, including the manager who was having difficulty understanding my situation while the counter staff girl was explaining.  The manager had to be told several times and it wasn't until the young lady spoke Spanish to her did she understand and approve the correction. By the way, it should have been simple because I brought the incorrect item back with the receipt.  I find this whole experience disturbing. I think that the young lady who will be making 15.00 an hr in a few years to put food in a bag should be able to do it correctly. This is not an educated position that requires a college.

Really. It takes a LOT of determination to fail this hardcore. I've worked fast food and i understand it can be stressful and hectic, but when there is only 2 or 3 customers THIS SHOULD NOT HAPPEN. My friend and i went to McDonalds tonight and i got my usual McDouble ONLY ketchup and Onions, sprite, coke and a caramel sunday. The guy taking our order did it very well and did it correctly. We get our order and we pull forward, i take a bite of my burger and, of course, there is ketchup, onion, mustard and cheese. Mind you, I've been taking Tylenol all day and my tummy is feeling kind of sick because of it but mustard makes me instantly suuuper sick to my stomach. So i almost puke right there in the car. We go back thru the drive thru and my friend looks at me and says, ""Literally every time we go to McDonalds they mess up your order, this time they almost made you puke. Give them hell."" So as soon as the lady comes on the intercom i say ""Do you guys not know how to read? I ordered a McDouble with ONLY KETCHUP AND ONIONS. Mustard makes me sick to my fucking stomach and i almost threw up because your cook doesn't know how to make a fucking burger. It isn't that difficult to READ and FOLLOW DIRECTIONS. Can you please give me another MCDOUBLE WITH ONLY KETCHUP AND ONIONS. The receipt taped to my fucking burger says ONLY KETCHUP ONLY ONIONS."" She replies ""pull to the next window."" We get to the window where the sweet kid who took our first order was and i told him he did a good job and it wasn't his fault, but we did want another burger. We explained the burger for a 3rd time. He said I'm sorry about that and then just closes the window. So we pulled up to the next window, waited a bit and the lady hands me out another burger. I opened it up and instantly said ""ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME????"" at that point i leaned over to the driver window and handed it to her and said ""does your cook not know how to read English? This burger has cheese, MUSTARD and pickles. I WANT A MCDOUBLE WITH KETCHUP AND ONIONS ONLY. I've worked fast food and i know it isnt that fucking difficult to make a fucking burger!!"" That's TWICE now they messed it up. After three times they finally made the stupid burger correctly. I'm literally astounded, it isnt rocket science to read a screen and assemble a goddamn burger correctly.. What if i had been deathly allergic to pickles or mustard? I understand if they would have been jam packed with customers then yes, things get confusing, but when there is literally 2 or 4 customer at the store then you shouldn't have to try 3 times to correctly make a hamburger. This is pathetic, your company in general has such an awful thought about not being able to correctly make food. Why don't you try and change that??
