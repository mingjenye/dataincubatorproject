This review is for the young man Thomas working by himself BUSTING his chops with 10+ people waiting.  All my god was fresh, even my special order of no salt fries (I don't do the back, I just don't like salted fries) and he was SO kind and SO courteous and SO hard working in the face of a bunch of classless drunk people and those of us being tourists.

9,1,7/31/2017,1.0,"So when your motel ""continental breakfast"" (aka jack sh*t) stops at 0930, what sounds good for quick food?   Well, its difficult to find in a town that does not have a lot of options.  McDonald's won out this time, yes, McDonald's.   The drive thru was absolutely packed, some jerk behind me honked at me for not moving, regardless of the fact there were people in front of me also not moving, but whatever, dude.  11 minutes later I get to the ordering intercom. Drive thru intercom wasn't working, so I had to repeat my order 4 times.  Come to find out two people didn't show up for their shift (as the person at the window claimed).  I get it, but that's not my problem.  I ordered a number 1 (Egg mcmuffin) with a large black coffee.  I was asked how I want that.  Really? It's.Black.  I also ordered a number 5 (bacon egg and cheese biscuit) with a large orange juice.   I pay, then pull up to the next window where I'm handed a small black coffee. ? After receiving the correct size, they ask me to pull around to the parking lot to wait for my order.    Employee walks out and asks the other 2 people also waiting if this was their order, before finally getting to me and reading my order to verify its mine.    Get back to my motel room only to find I have been given an egg mcmuffin with extra cheese and flat egg, (which I did not order) as well as a sausage biscuit and egg sandwich (which again, I did not order).  The kicker is that the idiot working in the back did not mark the wrapper on the egg mcmuffin as special, nor did he/she/they wrap the other sandwich correctly.  What showed on the outside as a bacon egg and cheese biscuit was mistakenly (I doubt on accident) filled with a sausage egg and cheese biscuit.   Then to top it off, the hashbrowns were COLD.  So cold they stuck to the wrappers.  And they did not put ketchup in my bag as requested.  Lame.  I know you're the only McDonald's for miles, but take some pride in what you do.",https://www.yelp.com//biz/mcdonalds-crescent-city?osq=McDonald%27s

I walked to the counter I looked at the employee with a stern intent to order some chicken nuggs. I placed my order, I wait for my food, and I received my food.

51,4,7/13/2016,3.0,Okay Location. Service is kind of slow but acceptable. Alright neighborhoods some transients kind of rough at night. Employee are always friendly and quirky. Food is on par with corporate standards. Fries are usually hot which is a plus.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-arcata?osq=McDonald%27s&start=0
52,4,10/6/2016,1.0,"The tables were all filthy, the ladies bathroom was filthy with someones personal garbage strewn all over the stall, there was dirt all over the sinks, and there was no toilet paper in either stall.  There are no napkins provided or water available, so we asked for a wet cloth to clean our own table, the clerk said she would do it, but never did.  Disgusting experience!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-arcata?osq=McDonald%27s&start=0
53,4,12/16/2016,3.0,Service is slightly slow. Standard McDonald's food. Wish the bathrooms were cleaner. Other than that don't have problems. Like that it's near a bunch of motels and Dollar Tree.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-arcata?osq=McDonald%27s&start=0
54,4,7/15/2016,1.0,"2 out of 3 times there's a problem. Definitely go somewhere else. I can't tell you how many times there's an issue. Cash only, tea isn't working, ice cream isn't working, this, that and this. I can't believe this McDonald's is till in business. Oh, and by far the worst service. If you want to get treated like crap and then have your food taste like crap go for it! Then this is the place for you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-arcata?osq=McDonald%27s&start=0
55,4,10/15/2016,1.0,Every time I go in they get my order wrong I guess it's my fault for not checking before I leave just happened again  And they didn't give me any of my sauces,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-arcata?osq=McDonald%27s&start=0

57,4,2/3/2016,1.0,Why have a 2 for $5 10 piece nuggets when there is a 20 piece for $5??? I just wanted 10 nuggets and a quarter pounder for $5 and I can't have it? That is pretty strange. If I want a quarter pounder on my own it is $4 plus tax..... Why make me get 2 for $5 and make me more unhealthy. Ridiculous to the max. Plus you got my burger order wrong after all that too. Shame shame shame......,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-arcata?osq=McDonald%27s&start=0
58,4,6/23/2016,4.0,"It's McDonald's so let's not get confused with a fine dining experience.  That said, the young lady was working hard to get orders out fast and she did it with a smile which was nice.  Food was OK. Bathroom could use a little work.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-arcata?osq=McDonald%27s&start=0
59,4,12/3/2015,1.0,Horrible. Asked for bacon egg sandwich and got sausage with no egg. Went in and handed the manager my receipt showing what I ordered. The receipt was correct the order was not. So they made me another. And it was wrong also.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-arcata?osq=McDonald%27s&start=0
60,4,10/1/2015,2.0,"Okay McDonalds, funky mix of folks. It's also a wee bit off the freeway, so you have to keep your Yelp app on to find your way. There were some degenerate-looking teens right outside that made me wish I'd parked our car somewhere visible from within. But it hit the spot as far as hunger.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-arcata?osq=McDonald%27s&start=0
61,4,12/7/2016,1.0,"Really disgusted with this location. After paying, I asked that the cashier put my change in the Ronald McDonald house donation box. He absolutely did not. I watched until he helped the next person. Not sure what the managers are telling these employees (if anything) but this was scandalous and I would hope that Mc Donald's Arcata CA would make this right.....",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-arcata?osq=McDonald%27s&start=20
62,4,1/26/2016,1.0,This place is so bad!! As the other reviews say they get their orders wrong! They forget your orders! Countless times do they forget something and get things wrong. No longer coming to this place. 15 dollars an hour my @55.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-arcata?osq=McDonald%27s&start=20
63,4,8/17/2016,1.0,"Called before I went to make sure they had a certain toy and they said they did, so I asked again before I ordered and they still said they did. I waited 20 minutes in the drive thru and was 1st in line to not get the certain toy. I went in and the manager looked like he was 12 and not very good because he didn't know what to do. Finally after about 10 minutes he finally gave it to me and I left. I will not go there again.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-arcata?osq=McDonald%27s&start=20
64,4,3/2/2014,1.0,"Literally every time I come here (work close, sometimes I have to) the employees are rude and almost always are talking in the back using profanity and being very unprofessional. They are rude to me and every other customer and very disrespectful. Food is fine, for being McDonald's, at least when they get the order right, but I am appalled at the customer service here.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-arcata?osq=McDonald%27s&start=20

66,4,2/12/2013,1.0,"I don't know what it is, but dang you work at McDonalds you put items bought into bags and give to customer. Well I have seen that this McDonalds has not yet mastered that sequence. Went there last month and order was not complete, went back to get items and they still missed some. So today I tried again, went there placed my order in the drive thru and came home and dang if my order was not complete again. We do not have huge intricate orders, there are only 3 of us and yet our orders are never right. Yes they charge us and no we do not get what we were charged for. I should of known to check the order before driving off but I thought oh its a $12 order, they can't mess this up....well they did. So here we are having to drive back once again to get our items, wasting gas that right now is $4.19. Moral of my story, always check your order here because they WILL get it wrong!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-arcata?osq=McDonald%27s&start=20
