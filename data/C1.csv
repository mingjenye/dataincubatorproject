0,1,7/22/2018,5.0,Great for kids! Easy to order screen. My kids say its the best McDonald ever. Kids have touch screen play activities.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-s-lake-tahoe?osq=McDonald%27s&start=0
1,1,6/20/2018,1.0,"I've seen the future of McDonald's at this location and it's the end of the company...  I heard they spent over $7 million on renovations to this location - it's clear their goal was to eliminate people. It isn't working unless the people they wish to eliminate fully are their customers.  As a former tech exec that has done thousands of user tests, their ""kiosks"" are a complete fail. Even the employees can't effectively navigate the giant iPads they're trying to force customers to use.  Further, because of their reliance on technology, they've ""skeletonized"" their staff to the bottom of the barrel. Not enough people, none of them trained at all.  Food - worst ever for a McDonald's and that's saying something. After returning several items because they were fried to the texture of shoe-leather, we waited 7 minutes for replacements that were equally awful.  Even worse, while we waited I watched an obviously handicapped senior citizen struggle with attempting to find a reasonable place to sit and eat.  The ""handicapped"" tables are too low and not even remotely appropriate for anyone that's disabled, their remaining ""bar stools"" are even worse.  I encourage everyone to come spend five minutes in this place to see an incredible futuristic failure in action. Then walk next door to subway.    That location sucks too, but at least a human is there to help you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-s-lake-tahoe?osq=McDonald%27s&start=0
2,1,4/8/2018,4.0,"Super fast service and good location. They have machines inside to take your order, so the process is quick (much faster than usual). It's either newly-built or renovated, and it looks quite snazzy. I love the style; it definitely fits into Tahoe!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-s-lake-tahoe?osq=McDonald%27s&start=0
3,1,10/19/2018,1.0,"Staff is very polite and pleasant, however it seems every time I get fast food in this town my order gets messed up. McDonald's needs to remove people and add machines to do the work that they now pay each employee $13 an hour to do. Automation removes human error from the equation. I won't be back until robots run the place",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-s-lake-tahoe?osq=McDonald%27s&start=0
4,1,12/30/2017,4.0,"This McDonald's is one of the ones that have been upgraded on the inside. On the food end, all the food was as expected from McDonald's. Hot, crispy McNuggets, 20 for 5$ deal, and a large 1,2, and 3 dollar menu filled the fam up good for a cheap price.   Customer service from the younger employees was great. They cleaned up the place and one of the guys worked hard to clean up the restroom, which is probably why is was so clean. The manager was either really tired or didn't know what was going on. I asked for the 2 for 2.50 deal and he said he was certain the deal was gone, but the outside sticker wasn't taken off. Then I noticed a 2 for 5 deal which included Big Macs and asked about that and he said he wasn't too sure about it and just pointed to the dollar menu. At the end, I decided that was the best option for cheeseburgers and just ordered it along with the nuggets deal.   Overall, I would recommend this fast food to anyone looking for a quick and cheap place to eat.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-s-lake-tahoe?osq=McDonald%27s&start=0
5,1,6/24/2018,1.0,"Came here twice while we visited Tahoe, and let me tell you both experiences were so bad. They pretty much forced everyone to use their order pay machine instead of ordering with the person and the wait for the food took 20 minutes. The second day, while we were waiting in the drive thru to place our order, they said that ""we no longer are taking any drive thru orders"". They didn't even bother to block the drive thru to prevent more people from coming. So we had to wait more time and have someone go inside to order. And while we are here waiting for our food, we see this garbage can. Who knows how long that has been full. Seems like since yesterday, because it's only 10am",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-s-lake-tahoe?osq=McDonald%27s&start=0
6,1,7/4/2018,5.0,"We came here on the 4th of July and this is hands down the best Mc Donald's I've been to. I'd say we were almost waited on too much, but can servers ever be too nice? We really liked the ordering Kiosk, it was easier to get our food just how we wanted it. Bathrooms and dinning area were all very clean. Staff was well kept looking.

8,1,9/3/2018,1.0,"Totally unexceptionable. We ordered at the machine, then had to wait in line to pay by register. The staff kept preparing for the drinks and did not know there was a line waiting to pay. We found a table to sit down as soon as we paid and patiently wait for our food. As time passed by, more and more customers walked in or waited for their food. I looked up the screen and realized that our number is not even on the in progress list as 20min passed by. My husband went up to the the registration and the guy told him the order was in, but when we asked him how long it would take, he said it's gonna be awhile. I was like what do you mean in awhile, we've been waiting forever. Not just us, other people too. So we decided to cancel our order, it's not worthy to wait. The store manager was cool cool head too while doing our refund. The worst McDonald's I had ever been.

I asked for the entire meal to be made fresh. when I got my order it had a slip on the Big Mac that said well done, which I did not ask for, I always ask for my food fresh here so everything should come out hot, well the meat was cooked so hard it was inedible, the fries were so NOT fresh, and they forgot to give me my water.

She dropped them on a tray and walked away without saying a word.   It doesn't do any good to have a nice new facility if the service is terrible and the staff is rude.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-s-lake-tahoe?osq=McDonald%27s&start=20

The employee says ""You can't order at the counter, you have to order at the kiosk and pay at the counter, thats how the owner of this McDonalds wants this done"". Absolutely stupid. As we continued our order at the kiosk, 3 people came to the counter and ordered food, even though the employee said thats impossible.  Customer service was horrible.  Then they brought the food to the table. Oatmeal was cold, they didn't bring napkins, hot sauce for burritos and they failed to bring the hash browns.  They brought out the oatmeal again, still cold.  $15/hr, yeah right.

Sometimes we have gotten fries that are so greasy that we played with them and turned them into pretzels. How can you honestly think anyone wants to eat a morsel of food that is plyable like playdoh? Other times the fries are so salty that they can't be eaten even after wiping them off. And who wants to take the time to wipe the salt off their food to make it edible?  Tonight was the last straw. It's a shame this minor mistake had to be the last straw. But after three years, we are waving the white flag. We ordered 3 plain McDoubles and 2 fries. What we got was 3 regular Mcdoubles and 1 fry. I ask you, why? How? Please help me to understand how this store consistently delivers a wrong order. We have never gotten an order right yet! Not as a walk in or in drive through.   Is this a joke? Are we on candid camera or something? Is this a test? Is this a creative way to profit? You tell me, because I'm trying not to bag on the possibility that your employees are just completely inept and or don't give a crap about their job.   If in fact, the latter is the problem then may I suggest that 1. You start drug  testing your employees. 2. Hire people who can count to 10 and can form a sentence.   Never again.

We rarely eat fast food but every now and then we'll get a craving for Mc D's.  I think that ended tonight.  In 19 years, I have had good food and bad food here.  My bad for continuing to return.  What I have experienced consistently, is that they CONSISTENTLY get our order wrong!!!  Without exaggerating, I would guess more than 80%!  Tonight, through the drive-thru, we ordered a Quarter Pounder without cheese and without onions along with some sweet n' sour sauce to go with the kids' chicken mcnuggests and some other food as well.  Got home and the Quarter Pounder had cheese AND onions and the patty looked grayish.  We had paid extra for two additional sauces but only received three (with two orders of mcnuggets).  So.....frustrated, I went back.  Talked to the manager (didn't get his name).  Explained the sitch and he apologized.  I was frustrated so I also explained that my family was eating dinner without me, that I've consistently had problems with McD's goofing my order, that In N' Out was the only fast food joint that had NEVER goofed my order (his response was, ""Yeah, In N' Out's really good""), and then I asked if I could have a fresh patty (rather than a gray one) to go with my burger....said he'd take care of it.  I sat back and watched them make my burger.  I watched a lady take a patty out of a drawer so I asked the manager about it.  He explained they make the patty's every two or three minutes.  I told him I understood, but would really like a fresh one.  Again, said he'd take care of it.  He went back, made a burger and I watched him put onions and two slices of cheese on it!!!!  Really??!  He apologized again, said he had ""spaced it"" and went back to make a new, fourth burger!  Finally it was done properly....well, I say properly, but I got home and it still had a grayish patty.  I'm not sure, but my wife thought the patty's were delivered to the store pre-cooked and they just warm them...maybe.  Anyhow.....we're done with Mc Donalds.  Even the kids were disgusted (6 and 8 years old)!!!    I think that last part says it all....we're done.

The food is your typical McDonald's food, nothing spectacular but they're fairly consistently average. (No soggy fries, mushy hamburger buns, etc.) The interesting thing that is they now started charging for things like extra pickles, or extra anything at both South Lake Tahoe locations.   It's sort of like how most fast food chains charge you for cheese, regardless of whether or not you get it on your burger. After getting nickled and dimed, if I choose to get a burger without cheese, I'll ask for it on the side. Makes a good treat for my dogs, otherwise it the cheese can feed the trashcan. Why? Because I PAID for it. (Okay, fine, that's a little immature. :) )  A number of times they've made mistakes, like neglect include the drink cup for a combo I've ordered. I normally phrase my statements to avoid laying blame, so I said, ""Hi, excuse me, can I get a cup for the combo meal? I didn't get one yet."" and the employee gave me the dirtiest look and slammed the cup down on the counter. (Actually, I think it was the manager who made the mistake and copped unwarranted attitude.)  It's not like I went up there and said, ""Hey, you ugly incompetent b**ch. You effin' forgot my G. d*mn cup!"" though perhaps that would have been more appropriate. I guess the imposition of correcting their own mistakes is so horrible they gotta act that way.

So, after a grueling 10 mile hike and having nothing other than nuts/chocolate covered raisins/sun ships to munch on, we were starving.  And despite the options available to us, we had to get home quick due to the clutch of dogs waiting patiently at home.  McD's it is.  This is a large location, right on Emerald Bay Rd right before the Y split that will either spit you out towards the strip of casinos or to the left to the quieter and less rowdy side of Lake Tahoe.  The bathroom was clean, except for one stall where someone had a losing battle with the flush mechanism.  Otherwise, I was able to wash my hands thoroughly after touching everything from the hike and the reek of fresh pine scent reminded me too much of Mr. Clean.  The inside of the establishment was clean as was the fun center for the children.  I noted the ""Keep your socks on"" policy for kids running around.  Good to know they were keeping foot fungus in check.  I ordered the McGrill Chicken Sandwich, which is actually the only thing I order unless I'm blind (their patties are too grey and I'm a medium-rare kind of a gal) which comes with a piece of green leaf lettuce, a slice of tomato, and dollop of mayo wrapped with a Pepperidge Farm bun.  The fries were hot and salted just the way I like them and for my extra effort/calories burned out on the ridge, I also ordered the soft serve vanilla cone for .99 cents.  What can I say.  After 6 hours of hiking, eating a value meal and the cone did little to perturb my healthier eating habits.  I think of it as already being burned ;)  Good staff and the food was hot.  Nicer that it is located right before you get out of S.

I went inside today because the drive up line had ten cars and I knew it would be faster. I ordered two Number Twos (the two cheeseburger meal) and an al a carte cheeseburger and small fry.  The cost was over $18 which seemed pricey, but with the moving menu board I couldn't find my meal in time so I paid and began filling my drinks.  (I hate that they don't have Lemonade any longer as this limits my caffeine free choices even more).  The drink station was cluttered with straw wrappers, soiled lids (with two in the ice grate), and various other trash, liquids etc.  The ice dispenser on the right didn't work at all.    After getting my drinks I heard another customer say, ""you don't have the cheeseburger meal?""  The cashier said, ""not anymore because we added the cheeseburger to the dollar menu.""  This made me pause because I had just ordered the cheeseburger meal... I focused on the menu screen and sure enough, the Number Two was now a quarter pounder meal.  There was no sign indicating something to the effect of, ""some of your favorite menu items may have changed"" and the cashier had said nothing to me.  After the cashier was done with her customer I explained to her that I didn't know that the Number Two was no longer two cheeseburgers, to which she replies, ""yeah, we changed it last night.""  I do feel as though if you are going to make a change to something that has been that way for 25 YEARS, maybe you mention to your customers that hey, did you want the cheeseburger meal or quarter pounders? Because what the hell?  The cashier was kind enough to supply a solution and refund me the quarter pounders, charge for the cheeseburgers, and we called it good.  But it does seem odd to me that they wouldn't mention a change like that.

Every visit to this store is a negative experience due to EXCESSIVE wait times. Today I decided to use the McDonald's App for curbside. 1. The App would not work curbside (I parked in curbside #3), so I had to go inside to get online and order. 2. Once I received confirmation, I walked back to my car, and got a notice that my order was not fully processed because I lost the WiFi connection. 3. Had to walk back inside, reconnect to WiFi in order to fully process, went to the window for ""App orders"" and confirmed with a manager who confirmed receipt of the order and said someone would bring it to curbside. 4. I actually arrived and started my order process at 10:00 AM. From the time I confirmed with the manager (who ran out of the store shortly after he confirmed my order), and waiting just under 5 minutes before someone brought my food curbside, the entire process took 21 minutes. 21 MINUTES!  I understand things get busy. I understand extenuating circumstances, however, every time I visit or anyone I know visits the McDonald's, you can count on a wait time of at least 20-25 minutes.

I said no and she said ""well, okay..."" and a long pause, she didn't offer an apology or no form or regard.  I became upset and definitely told her it is ridiculous and this was not done by accident or mistake - we were given old chicken and whoever gave it to us knew.  And also, no, I don't want to return because even though we aren't that far out - staying at the grand residence - but that means, waiting for valet to bring our car back up, taking baby downstairs, loading baby back in the car seat, driving there and then dealing with this unprofessional and horrible staff?

I don't expect a lot when I come to Mcdonalds, but please get the orders out fast and clean off the tables!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-south-lake-tahoe?osq=McDonald%27s&start=100
219,3,3/16/2009,3.0,There's a WALK-THRU!  Remember all those times you tried to get late night fast-food in high school when all other places were closed but couldn't because their restaurant was closed except for their drive-thru?  And then they punished you for not having a car and kept you from getting food?  Well not here!  Come to the walk-thru at this McD and stick it to the man.  Whoever that man is that proclaimed that customers without a car can't use the drive-thru.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-south-lake-tahoe?osq=McDonald%27s&start=100
220,3,4/23/2008,3.0,"Things must have seriously changed after I moved. I'm reading the reviews and that's all that I can think of. It's been years since I have actually ate at a McDonald's let alone this one, but the times I did, this place was never that great. The food aside. This place is always busy. Part of that has to do that it's the only McDonald's at that end of town and the fact that it is without a drive-thru, which is a major pain.   Customer service was mediocre at best.  The food again... it's McDonald's. You know what to expect.  If you need to eat here, then it'll be okay. Although drive down to Carson City and get In-N-Out. That's what I would do. :)",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-south-lake-tahoe?osq=McDonald%27s&start=100
221,3,5/26/2008,4.0,"McD's is our go-to place for a quick, cheap, and easy breakfast...especially prior to big trips. This is one of the newer and nicer McD's out there, with plenty of seating indoors. The employees are friendly, though lack a bit of knowledge about the menu. (If I order a sausage mcmuffin, it is not necessary to ask me if I want egg with it...) Somehow, though the place was just about completely full, everything moved expediently and the restaurant was clean. Minus a star for the lack of a real ""dollar"" menu...items ended up being about $1.39 instead.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-south-lake-tahoe?osq=McDonald%27s&start=100
222,3,5/9/2011,2.0,Hate fast food but eat here once a year... Have lived in Tahoe 14 years... THERE WAS NEVER EVER A DRIVE THRU AT THIS LOCATION!!!!

223,3,5/5/2009,2.0,"We wanted to grab a quick lunch on the way back home. I found a coupon in one of the visitors guides in the lobby of our timeshare. It was buy 2 extra value meals and get one free. I told the cashier I had the coupon and I bought 3 big mac meals and 2 kids meals.   She couldn't figure out how to enter the coupon into her register. Understandable since she looked like she's never seen the coupon before. She made a few attemps and couldn't get in right. She called over her supervisor or manager who also couldn't enter in the coupon. After a few tries, she finally gets it.  The cashier was pretty ticked off at me which I don't understand since I waited patiently for her to get it correctly into her system. So it's MY fault SHE didn't know how to enter in a coupon?!?!  Besides the awful service from the employee, food came out quick and hot.  Soda fountain is self serve and they have a good selcetion of sodas.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-south-lake-tahoe?osq=McDonald%27s&start=120

225,3,11/2/2010,3.0,"How you gonna dog McDonald's? Okay, this one doesn't have a drive-thru, but is it really so bad to go inside? They have the same consistant food McDonald's serves everywhere: Quarter Pounders, Chicken Nuggets, Cheeseburgers, Big Macs, Filet O' Fish, fries, ice cream cone, Coca-cola--all the classics, always the same.  We often joke that traveling on the highway is a McDonald's to McDonald's adventure.

226,3,10/30/2010,3.0,"This location has a ""walk thru"" so that you can order your food without ever stepping inside. My lil bro thought this was so awesome that he even took a picture standing by it. It's an interesting concept. At other McD's, I have on occasion seen people walking up to a drive thru lane, ordering and then walking up to the windows to pay and pickup their food. It's usually late night and it is hilarious to me for some reason.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-south-lake-tahoe?osq=McDonald%27s&start=120
227,3,12/11/2010,1.0,"I stopped here after picking up my daughter from camp on my way to Sacramento. I figured the Walk through would be faster than going in. It took 15 minutes from the time I placed my order to get my food and there was no one in front of me. I finally stuck my head inside the window and asked if I should go inside as about 10 people including my daughter who went inside to get a drink, had come and gone.  Being a tahoe/truckee local I thought maybe they assumed I was a tourist or something.

228,3,2/14/2010,1.0,Getting breakfast here is an excruciating experience. The place is conviently located down the road from Heavenly so it sees a fair share of hungry skiers and snowboarders looking to load up before they hit the slopes. You would think the place would be able to crank out McMuffins in the typical Mickey Ds fashion but this place is in a class of it's own.

229,3,8/10/2009,1.0,"I thought McDonalds had standards to prohibit bad service. Not this one.  I went in for a simple mini meal which was fine.  But I watched three orders be done incorrectly in just the time it took to eat my meal.  The staff was also rude to people who complained.  In addition I watched as a woman tried to get service while several employees milled about behind the counter.  When she spoke up and said she would like to place an order, a clever young employee turned his back to her and said, ""I'm tired of taking orders."".  Few people actually go to McDonald's for good food.  So if service is slow and bad, what's left?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-south-lake-tahoe?osq=McDonald%27s&start=120
