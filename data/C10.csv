South west dressing is on the side in a very large dressing pouch.

Aren't these supposed to be open during business hours? -The fry boxes were barely squeezed open (this is was the first part of being nickel-ed and dime-ed) Arggghh!  See picture, none yet eaten!  I figured this was intentional as store was crowded and this I figured is why they were stuffed in bag- I would have noticed if on tray.  These were less than half full.  -What I learned much later, when reading the receipt is that my two for $4, half full fries were actually charged at the regular price of two medium fries!  So another $0.30 extra, but what bothers me about this most is that I clearly told the clerk 2 for 4 or whatever, why would their registers even allow this and it dawned on me....$0.30 x millions sold per day is a lot of money for McDs.  I see a class action here!   Overall food was tasty, but the other things so turned me off, last straw  for me and reason we now search for (in and out) or (the habit) is over this crazy menu issue.  Hwy 99 from now on...there's an In-N-Out on the way.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-colusa?osq=McDonald%27s&start=0153,4,1/27/18,1,"Easy as 1,2,3 menu, sucks.

I actually went through this place TWICE in one week as I was driving north and then back home. I decided I would combine my experiences-  1st trip- Despite having just read a Buzzfeed article on the amount of chemicals and artificial junk put into a strawberry shake here, I went ahead an ordered on. Received said shake and my experience was as follows: employee hands me shake dripping in melted milkshake and mysterious red juice, I take shake and as I am moving the shake from my left hand to my right hand to set it in the cup holder, the lid comes flying off and the cherry that was placed on top of the shake falls onto the floor of my car. Driving away I reached into my bag for a napkin to wipe up the sticky mess that was all over my hands and car and to my dismay, there were none to be found. 2nd trip- against better judgement I went through again, this time ordering a cheeseburger (I know, don't judge me. I was starving). Received order, opened up, only to find that the plastic yellow garbage they are supposed to place on top of the burger (I know, that's what I get for going here in the first place) was not even on my burger, but rather melted to the paper wrapper. Instead of the normally small chunks of onion that are sprinkled on top of the patty, I received a full, thick chunk of uncooked onion on top of the burger, and no pickles (fine I hate pickles anyway). My fries were not only cold, but they were soggy and brown. My drink had about 2 sips and the rest was ice.   I don't really expect more out of McDonalds or any fast food chain for that matter, so I guess this review is somewhat pointless, but if you can afford to wait a while until you reach civilization where a sit-down restaurant is available, that is what I would advise.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-colusa?osq=McDonald%27s&start=20176,4,7/27/15,1,"I worked at this location for over a year and a half, and it was the unhappiness I have ever been. If you've had a bad experience here take the time to read through my review.  I would like to start off by saying this location is a very busy, off the interstate multi-million dollar McDonalds. Unfortunately the general manager here, Irma, is a complete moron. She's a nice lady at the root, but is incredibly incompetent when it comes to leading a team that fits the needs of a store of this magnitude. The only reason she is the boss is because she has been working there since she was 16 and somehow managed to make her way up the ladder. She promotes and assigns people to stations based on personal relationships and not merit. She micromanages to the point that the staff is so confused about the goals that it's utter and compete chaos. And worse of all all the staff there is immensely undertrained. My first day there was the Saturday before Thanksgiving, and I was thrown at a computer taking orders with absolutely no prior knowledge of McDonalds and the food they sold. After that I had to figure everything out myself, and was constantly reprimanded for not following McDonalds protocol. We were told to be friendly and take the time to make sure everything was made right and up to par but were only given 90 seconds from the customer ordering, to leaving with their food to do so (and we were yelled at if we went over our time).  If you ever come to this location and have a bad experience don't bother calling and telling Irma because she'll more than likely laugh and make fun of your complaint with her staff (I speak from experience, I had to kiss her butt in order to get more than 15 hours a week). I suggest calling the corporate office, or finding the number for their Yuba City office who is Irma's direct higher up.

Slam",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-chico-7?osq=McDonald%27s&start=20216,5,9/28/16,1,"I'm reposting for the safety of our Chico Community!  Stay away!   PLEASE SHARE: My 67 year old father went to the McDonald's across from Pleasant Valley High School in Chico California this past Friday (9/23/2016). He brought in his own cup so he was not wasting a cup which he has done for years.  He paid the employee at the counter $1.08 for a soda and walked over to the machine to start filling his cup.  A man in all black walked over to him and said, ""You need to pay for that ""my father said ""Oh, I paid for this, I am just re-using a cup so I'm not wasting a cup"", the man said to him again, ""you need to pay for that, let me see your receipt.""  My Dad said to the man, ""You are not trying to accuse me of stealing this are you?""  The man then said to my father, ""Shut the f*** up"".  The employee that took my father's money verified that he had paid for the drink.  My Dad told the man that his employee had just verified that he had in fact paid for the drink and my Dad was once again told to ""shut the f*** up"".  My Dad asked for his money back and said that he would leave he again was told to ""shut the f*** up"" again and a few more times after that.  My Dad asked to speak to the manager and he was told by the man in all black that he was the owner so there would be no talking to anyone higher then him.  The owners name is Mark Burington and when my father asked for the corporate number Mr. Burington refused to give it to him.  So he went home and with the help of my step-mom, they were able to find a local corporate number.  As they told their story, they were hung up on.  We now know that Mr. Burington owns all of the local McDonalds so that corporate number he called was the one for his stores. (Update: he owns most of, if not all of the Butte county McDonalds) At the time this was occurring, there were about 20 students from the high school across the street standing in the same area watching and listening to this happen.  My father was embarrassed, disparaged and slandered in front of all of these young men and women.  He also felt very threatened and unsafe being in the establishment.  But putting aside my father's feelings, I have strong concerns over what happened in front of these young people and the McDonalds employees. A complaint has been filed with the Better Business Bureau and local media will be contacted but no story will probably ever show up because McDonalds is a huge advertiser so I am hoping this will get shared.  I am concerned over this uncontrollable man that lashed out with inappropriate language.  I understand that McDonalds is a franchise and individual owners own each restaurant but shouldn't there be some accountability for these owners to represent the McDonalds ""Ambition"" stated right on the company website?... ""Our purpose goes beyond what we sell. We're using our reach to be a positive force. For our customers. Our people. Our communities. Our world.""  Nothing about this owner or my father's experience was positive.  Being a ""Good Neighbor"" is also stated right on the McDonalds website, ""We champion happy, healthy kids. Keep families together through Ronald McDonald House Charities. Commit to reducing our footprint. Using less energy. And recycling more.""  My father was trying to reduce our footprint by recycling his cup but was degraded and threatened for doing so.  Look at the yelp reviews of this place... it sounds like my father has not been the first to be treated horribly. Until this mess is resolved and McDonalds removes a hostile man from being around children and our community, I would strongly urge the Chico Community to boycott all McDonalds owned by Mr. Burington.  Especially if you have kids that attend PV.h",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-chico-7?osq=McDonald%27s&start=20217,5,3/2/17,1,This owner is a poor representation for the MacDonalds corporation.

Today we were again in the drive-thru, were asked to wait for the last 1/3 of our order ""just two minutes"" in the parking area and we declined, retelling our problems with their park and wait system.  The man running the window asked for a manager to come over and she asked what the problem was.  Again I explained what had happened, and informed her that one of the two minutes we were asked to wait had all ready passed, so it should just be right out, right?  The ""manager"" said ""have a nice day"" shoved the window closed and left.  Four minutes the balance of our order was delivered; two large orders of fries.    Now here is the really amazing part; the second fries had so much salt that they could not be eaten and were thrown away.  The first fries and the two burgers were fine.  My question is, did this so called manager intentionally ruin the food?  Well, if you have ever eaten at a McDonald's then you can be the judge.

One might think that given McDonald's current dwindling market share they would make an effort not to drive away customers, not to INTENTIONALLY produce food that could not be eaten and may have been so loaded with salt as to represent a health hazard to anyone eating it.  In the shopping area as this McDonald's is a Jack in The Box and a Carl's JR.  The burgers fries at McDonald's are not so unique that they can not be replaced or in fact improved upon at either of the other places.  Finally, this rude, bitter, and vindictive ""manager"" was training the young man who original gave us the first 2/3 of our order.  I wonder what lesson he learned from today's shift?

These issues only started happening within the past 6 months or so, so maybe something has changed for the worst recently.  Here's the situation: I order a Quarter Pounder Deluxe meal every time. I typically order it with no pickles or onions, but I've started not making it a special order, so that I'll maybe actually get the right thing. That doesn't work. 3 times out of 5 they give me a regular quarter pounder with cheese instead of the Deluxe. Which means no mayo and no veggies other than pickles and onions.  I even order it by using the meal combo number and they still give me the wrong burger. I sent my boyfriend to get it for me last night, he said the lady told him ""the regular quarter pounder with cheese is cheaper"" he said ""no it's fine"", they still gave him the quarter pounder with cheese instead of the deluxe. Are they trying to save on lettuce and tomato or something? Why would they downsell that? They also shorted us an order of fries last night. And one of the few times when they actually did give me the deluxe... it was missing the burger patty and cheese! It was just mayo, lettuce, and tomato on a bun! I was on my lunch break at work so I couldn't just go back and get the correct order so I threw some fries on it and had me a fry sandwich.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-yuba-city?osq=McDonald%27s&start=0433,15,3/3/17,5,This McDonald's has NEVER messed up my order and the staff is very polite. I normally wouldn't take the time to review a fast food restaurant but they never let me down. I'm lactose intolerant and always order my burger with no cheese. Most places have a really hard time with that!,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-yuba-city?osq=McDonald%27s&start=20434,15,7/20/17,2,"First thing that I noticed was that the restaurant was dirty inside...  Unfortunately, I noticed this after I had ordered.  When I got to my location with my food, I found that they had messed that up too.  This was my 1st (and last time) visiting this location.  They, obviously, don't practice the same standards as all of McDonald's other locations.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-yuba-city?osq=McDonald%27s&start=20435,15,6/18/17,1,"This location has awful management and customer service. To start, a friend and I pulled into the drive thru and up to the speaker to order. We ask the girl for six egg mcmuffins, but we needed two without Canadian bacon. We had to repeat this about five times to her as she kept asking about sausage mcmuffins (an honest mistake, whatever). After multiple attempts to explain what we needed, she was not understanding and rudely asked us to pull up to the window because ""she couldn't understand us"". We eventually got up to the window, where she finally was able to take our order. We then pulled up to the second window, when a guy kindly told us that our food would be a minute and we should pull up on the side to wait. We waited maybe five minutes (no big deal at all) when a woman comes up (very closely) to the window with our food. We roll down the window only to have this woman LECTURE US on how inconsiderate it is to order breakfast food after 11am (even thought McDonalds CLEARLY advertises all-day-breakfast!) because the bfast food is made to order. (Side note: In N Out ALWAYS does made-to-order, but you don't see them bitching at customers about their job!). After a worthless two minute lecture, we finally drove away with our food. As we're driving away I look at all the egg mcmuffins and they all have Canadian bacon. This happens to me often, and it's an honest mistake. So we turn the car around, walk inside, wait in line, and the girl at the register goes to get a manager. Now let me tell you, this manager was beyond rude. After the girl at register had told her about our issue, the manager did everything in her power to make us wait for her. After waiting for five minutes for this woman, she finally rudely tells us to come over. ""What's the problem?"" she says in a rude tone. We repeat the situation, AGAIN, and instead of apologizing or offering us compensation, she tells us to give her two of the mcmuffins, throws them away right in front of us, and has one of her employees give us the new ones. Never an apology from this manager, just a crap attitude towards two polite customers over her stores mistake. We never acted rude or impatient, we smiled and assured them the order mess up wasn't a big deal, because it really wasn't! As someone who has worked in food and knows how difficult people can be, I was really disappointed in the way this situation was handled.

Ok here is the story:   I just felt like a Quarter Pounder--haven't you ever felt just like having one, (comes over me maybe 1 or 2 times per year).  I ordered the value meal of a single quarter pounder, (small) with 6 piece chicken Mc Nuggets.  I was hungry ok..!   They put the fries out on my tray pretty fast, normally this is very cool, but not when you are waiting almost 12 min for the other food to get finished. (cold fries)   Finally My Q P came out with the Nuggets, but wait...

I almost got backed into by a huge GMC Yukon during my last visit because the driver couldn't make the turn.

Not a assurance she is competent enough to handle a position in the food service industry or gives a shit about her job, her reputation or her customers experience. Pretty sure she pocketed the .30 for herself. After a shift she must be getting away with $20-30 to feed her drinking or drug habit. I think it's safe to say her parents were not intelligent or competent enough to instill any values in this lil bitch. That being said I'm pretty sure my fish filet looked like it was put together by her father, obviously the gene pool wasn't to bright for any of their staff. The bun is a circle, the patty is a square. It's gotta be difficult for that to be assembled properly for those who have no common sense or lack of any skill what so ever. But the cheese is square, so what's the excuse there? I will be contacting McDonald's corporate regarding this to get my money back.

I have had this two experiences with this location and both of them were terrible. I have worked in fast food before and I know sometimes you can have an off day so I gave them a try again and it was awful. We waited inside for 30 min and then I got the food out to the car and opened it and it was all wrong. So I went back in and just got my money back. I could tell they were having some issues with the credit card machine or something but no one seemed worried or even looked like they were trying to move quickly. The people in front of me where waiting still when I got my money back. The young man who took the orders at one point stopped to talk with some friends. I have a long drive with two small children and no time for that kind of service.,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-anderson-19?osq=McDonald%27s&start=20591,20,5/14/15,1,Holly crap!!!!!

This McDonald's is a joke! The staff is VERY RUDE and the young guy manager walked up and threw my food on the counter, when I asked for sweet and sour sauce he acted like I was bothering him!

Kinda caught me of guard,  with my wife in the car I did not say anything back to her at the time...I guess this is the mcd's way of saying 'THANK YOU FOR YOUR BUSINESS.'  Read about the Mcd's in Banning, Ca. on the I-5 going into Palm Springs...you'll see that this is the norm for this poorly run corporate chain... no more mcd's for me after this gift card is used up...end of story",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-anderson-19?osq=McDonald%27s&start=20595,20,6/10/15,1,Currently waiting in line for 10 minutes.

When I usually call about something bad which doesn't happen a lot when I go there, they would usually be like, "" I'm sorry about that if you bring in the receipt for the order we will replace it.""or something like that. I tell them I live a good distance where I don't want to drive all the way back because it's a waste of gas and a Waste of my time. I was just going to give the nuggets to my younger siblings instead after I called but when I told the guy on the phone probably a manager what the problem was. He told me I had to drive all the way back with the food and the receipt instead of just letting me get it another time when i was back in town. It happens to be that my car wouldn't start so I had to use my girlfriends car and her AC is broken in the car and it is 101 degrees outside. I went there to get my nuggets and when I got there a manager in glasses pointed at me and said,"" aye give that guy a 20 piece"". I waited about 8 minutes and some nice old Hispanic lady gave them to me but I didn't get an apology or anything. All I got were stares from the employees.
