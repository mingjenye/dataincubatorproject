0,7/20/2018,3.0,"This location has just gone through a renovation and it looks a lot nicer. They added a touch screen ordering system in the middle that you can use and pay with via card only. I didn't see anywhere that accepted cash on it. You still have the option of ordering from a live person. They also have a separate station that is a pick up window only, no registers, which is really nice and makes order pick ups faster. I noticed that they really up'd their game with speedy service too. So far I really enjoyed the touch screen system. It was really easy to use. You can add or remove things from your sandwiches.   I think they also changed their business hours because they're usually closed by 11p but I've seen customers in there way past midnight.",https://www.yelp.com//biz/mcdonalds-chicago-31?osq=McDonald%27s

My food came out really hot and fresh - even the fries. With McDonalds I feel like you're playing Russian Roulette with how fresh the fries are, so I appreciated this.  The only thing I didn't like was that they were mopping the floors where people were standing/trying to order. Isn't that a safety hazard? People were moving out of the way so the girl could finish and she almost mopped their feet.",https://www.yelp.com//biz/mcdonalds-chicago-31?osq=McDonald%27s

5,1/21/2018,2.0,"I was walking back from a play to the Brown line on Sunday evening and every other coffee place was closed or too far, so I slipped in here.  Visually this is a sexyish little McD, more sleek and modern and cafe-like than the standard branch.  Unfortunately the team member that took my order was a little off--listen I don't really have high expectations for McDonalds but this was below even regular human interaction standard, without any sense of care and a far-away deadened sense.   There was a listless grabbing for receipts in a stack and she gave me the receipt and order number for a few people before me, so I just waited for the coffee to come up and make sure i was the only one going for it.   It wasn't up to the standards of usual edibility, I could consume about half and had to throw it out, it was very watery (most of the time McD coffee is decent since their update).  I'll just skip it next time.",https://www.yelp.com//biz/mcdonalds-chicago-31?osq=McDonald%27s

They will come up to you while eating as well. A couple fights ensued in the short time while we were there. And this is just 2:00 in the afternoon. They do not take ""no"" for an answer and the employees are oblivious. Management seems to be unable to control the trash as it seems to just pile up all around tables and trash cans. Not sure if this is a McDonalds problem or a Chicago problem, but either way, this is not good for tourism or for attracting business from outside. This is a really great location and it is the new two story building with lots of glass, so it looks like it should be a flagship store.

I stopped into this location, store # 14173, order #135 on my way home from work to grab a late night burger.(10:12 pm) I was approached by two homeless men while I was fillings own soda waiting for my order. When I felt threatened and told them I ""do not have any change."" I turned to look into the dining room and see this photo I took...

I'm writing this review because for the past several years I've ventured in one of the employee's, named Terry (of 6 years), has usually been the one taking my order. I've been extremely impressed by her demeanor and her professional attitude is probably the best I've ever seen in the food industry. She moves quickly and efficiently, and I always feel reassured that she's going to get my order right.

29,4/6/2018,1.0,"I HAVE ONLY BAD THINGS TO SAY ABOUT THE MANAGER IN THIS PLACE! She is a bitter woman that does not know how to handle and talk to customers...I live in the neighborhood and my first bad experience with her was ordering something to go one day...I stayed one minute to argue and trying to make her understand that ""to-go means in a bag"", so I can carry all the items with me...she told me that they're not allowed to give those plastic bags away...and when I asked her ""Well what are you using them for then?"" and pointed to the stack that they had behind her... she finally had nothing else to say and gave me one...to be fair I would not ask for a bag if I ordered just a portion of fries, but I had several sandwiches , fries, a McSunday, plus drinks since the order was for me and my girlfriend, how would you carry those if not in a to-go bag?! I am usually a polite person, I try to be understanding but when i'm faced with stupidity, I can't agree with it! THE WORST PART COMES NEXT: Recently I stopped by the place after finishing work and went inside...I walk up to the counter and half way through this lady yells after me ""Hey you, excuse meee!""...no hey sir...hey you...like on the farm, no respect, no nothing... so I turn around and asked what happened, what is the problem...she got by the door and was shouting at me ""we're closed...we're closed...SHOUTING...not saying ""Sorry, unfortunately we are closing...I apologize!"" none of that...again, I'm understanding, if a place is closing I'm not ridiculous, I understand them...but when I'm confronted with this level or rudeness, I must say something! I don't even write reviews here, but this excuse of a manager deserves it... So I reply ""Well what about the people that are next to me by the register and ordering now, how am I different than them? It is not closed for them too? If you are closed then why are the doors not locked and why are you shouting after me already being in the restaurant? Are you locking the doors now and you thought you can throw me out, or what?"" ""We're closed...we're closed""...She was stuck on repeat! I also felt embarrassed because as she was shouting, and everyone turned at me, since I was close to the ""order here"" line. Then I reply...""How am I different from these people here in front of me that are just ordering? Please explain to me that? What about if I go outside walk to the drive through window (the drive through is open 24 hours), and I order from there...how is that different than ordering from here? Is it not going to be the same thing? I'm actually going to be faster than them cause there's no line at the window outside""...""We're closed...we're closed"" I swear, her batteries were persistent...I won't buy anything from this place anymore and advise people not to do so either...If she is on the shift and you encounter her, you will understand why I wrote this review! I don't expect 5 star service from a fast food place, but at least politeness...and no shouting or ""Hey you"" crap! I live nearby and used to be a regular, stoping by their place all the time, but now that's going to change...maybe I'll swing by one last time and buy that lady an ice cream to make her bitterness go away!

I'm here more often than I'd like to admit since I work close by, and out of the many orders I've placed, only two have been incorrect--once they misheard and just put in the wrong item, and another time I asked for honey mustard in addition to the usual sauce, and I had to ask for it again before I left. Not a big deal, but the employee I dealt with through that whole order just didn't want to be there. A customer shouldn't be able to tell quite how much you hate your job. Really.

He was new apperantly and did not have anyone to help him till the end. The cashier didn't know what items McDonald's has to offer or the basic promotions (the 2 for $3). After explaining myself more than four times, another employee noticed my agitation and came over to help complete the order. Once my order was ready to pick up, I quickly checked it and left, which was my mistake since I know this location often messes up orders. Once I got home and started to distribute the food to my family I noticed that I was missing two burgers. I then called that location to let them know of the issue and asked to speak with the manager. The managers name is Carmen. She refused to help me on the issue saying that she was the one that put it together and that she saw me check it and leave. I told her I did check it but did not count the items correctly. Her reply was that if I checked it I should of told her at the time something was wrong. How can you check a bag stuffed with 8 flat burgers without being in the way for the next customer and after a long stressful day at work? Again that was my mistake for not taking the whole thing apart. Once I told her I wanted to speak with someone higher than her since she was very adamant on not rectifying her mistake, she then told me that the reginal manager, Michael, was available. Once I was being passed over, Michael was supposedly busy out of nowhere and couldn't take my call. Then the manager Carmen told me that I can call the 1800 number, which I did and filed a complaint, or call tomorrow and speak to the other manager. Overall this is not the first time I had an issue with this manager on rectifying errors made by them and shorting the customers money and items. I am also writing a complaint on the BBB since this manager does not do anything but put up a wall and ignore customer feedback/complaints.

This was a VERY unpleasant encounter with this manager. I have NEVER just sat in a McDonalds, or any venue and not ordered. I DO NOT LOITER and was quite offended that this person insinuated that.  In fact, I always order and take it home except this day I did sit for a a minute ( and earlier at breakfast I ordered my usual grub and sat maybe 5-7 minutes and took the rest home) or two as I completed my call, but I just got there and it was like this person appeared out of nowhere and started grilling me?

89,3/1/2018,1.0,"Until a new owner took over this McDonald's location this was our ""go to"" for a quick, nutritious egg white delight and cup of coffee. The new changes implement by the new owner may be suggestions from MCD Corporate offices but each owner has the option to implement those that are appropriate for its clientele. The owner is pushing ordering at a kiosk, table delivery, Uber pick up, etc. If I want table service I'll go to IHOP or a dozen other restaurants in the neighborhood. The kiosk doesn't let you easily customize your sandwich or order the ancillary items, i.e. plasticware. Due to Uber and Lyft drivers waiting for a fare the parking lot is full of drivers who are only there to use the free Wifi and bathroom. No food just these ""free services"" to the detriment of restaurant patrons who need to park to ""Eat-In"". Sadly, with the new changes being forced on this team, the service has really declined.   The new owner has forced the existing team to add more tasks but not provided additonal staff to support. Employees who used to take orders, smiled at patrons and handed out meals are now trying to force and teach people to order at the kiosk, carry trays to tables and return to the kitchen to pick up missing items since they can't be ordered at the kiosk, etc. Therefore, the cleaning of the restaurant and bathrooms has begun to declined. I spoke with the owners ""regional manager"" who tried to say that the problem is the current management. I told her that after coming to this McDonald's an average of 6 mornings a week for the past 4 1/2 years, the problem is definitely not the current restaurant management but the new owner and the changes they have imposed. We're disappointed as many of the employee's we considered ""friends"" and have written many positive comments regarding their service. On two occasions I've taken time to speak with the new owners representatives when they were visiting this location. I shared the concerns, especially the issue of the Uber drivers and made the suggestion to either reduce the Wifi coverage so it only worked inside the restaurant or putting a time limit like they do at the airport and other businesses. The comments seem to have fallen on deaf ears.  The clientele of this MCD location is a study of social dynamics from Society ladies in Lincoln Park/Lakeview to residents of transient hotels. It's not everyone cup of tea but we've found it very interesting and found many of the transients are very interesting, intelligent people. In our 4 1/2 years we've only encountered a couple of hobo's panhandling for money and in each of those instances, the management handled the situation without embarrassing the individual and making the patrons uncomfortable. We miss not coming but the MCD but after 7 months under the new owner, it got to much and we've found other locations for our morning breakfast.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-chicago-54?osq=McDonald%27s&start=0

Before getting out of my car, I paused for a moment to respond to a text message that I'd received on my mobile phone. Just then, one of the restaurant's managers, a Latina, felt it necessary to walk all the way out to my car, up to my passenger-side window and say ""you can't park here"" in a condescending voice, shaking her finger.  Well, I wasn't just ""parking there"" lady.  I was actually there to patronize your establishment, but you can certainly bet I won't do so again.

Even the restrooms were spotless.  Only negative was lack of paper towel.  Look, I get the cheap thing with only air blowers, but still a basic necessity is to have paper towel.  So just grab a handful of napkins before going into wash your hands.

132,8/19/2018,4.0,"I don't think I've ever rated a McDonald's before because, you know, it's McDonald's.  It's not as if you don't know what to expect--only this one defies expectations in a good way.  This new McDonald's opened in August 2018 with a unique, attractive and eco-friendly design.  It has solar panels on top, a glass atrium for dining, and a hanging garden. The 1,062 rooftop solar panels provide around 60% of the energy needed to run the store.   The decor is quite pleasing. It features lots of wood, tile and natural light.  You order at large kiosks. The design of these kiosks still needs some work. I found the usability poor. Sometimes you need to hit buttons at the top of the giant flat panel and sometimes you use buttons on the very bottom. It's a bit difficult to scroll, and we ended up inadvertently adding an item we didn't want. (McDonald's needs a bit of usability help to keep the users' eyes in one part of the screen, use more consistent controls, and make better use of the giant screen. It's as if whoever designed this interface decided to ignore best practices learned from two decades of e-commerce web design.)  One unique aspect of this McDonald's is that you can order and have it delivered to your table versus waiting at a counter. The order took a little longer than I would've expected to arrive, stretching the definition of ""fast food"" a bit, but the surprisingly nice ambiance made waiting much more pleasant.   In the end, it's still the same McDonald's burgers and fries you either hate or love, but I commend the chain for doing something different and interesting with this location.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-chicago-178?osq=McDonald%27s&start=0

136,10/1/2018,2.0,"Very nice looking new McDonalds. UNFORTUNATELY the services does not live up to the image. Im not one to bash the service at fast food places simply because they are fast food. When i was a kid my first job was at a mcdonalds so i have sympathy for them. However there is a basic standard they must live up to.   This is a brand new store. Im unsure if its corporate owned or franchised but they need some basic training this includes the two managers and what appeared to be a district manager or equivalent named debbie.   If you park there you must get your ticket validated. I went to the counter where they hand out the food and validate. I put my empty cup with the top off on the counter for a refill and held my lid, straw, and parking ticket as they handed out food.   A few minutes later it became apparent that nobody was going to take notice. Other customers got their food. Debbie the district manager (i assume this because she had the McD vest and was checking on the other managers before leaving) and two other managers hovered nearby. Employees walked back and forth and one inexplicably leaned against a wall 4 feet in front of me for some unknown reason.   At some point after a few minutes i thought i would simply turn on my timer. Just to see how long i could remain invisible. A little over 5 minutes went by. Then an employee finally asked if i needed anything. When i said i needed my ticket validated he even commented ""oh youve been standing here a long time"". Then for some reason the refill took another minute. That part i cant figure out. Its a refill. I stopped the timer when he handed me the drink. Almost 7 minutes. You could add another 5 minutes since i started after i became frustrated. But lets just leave it at the almost 7 minutes standing at the counter waiting to get my ticket validated.   Im not writing this for customers. Its McDonalds. You sort of know what you are getting into. But I'm hoping management will see this. Likely they will not care but someone might and perhaps some basic training for the managers will be held.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-chicago-178?osq=McDonald%27s&start=0
137,9/13/2018,2.0,"They tore down the old Rock n Roll McDonald's and replaced it with a big giant glass box that has no personality and could be located anywhere in the world. Very sad, because when my niece &amp; nephew (8 and 6) came to visit from Europe, the Rock n Roll McDonald's was one of the things they liked best downtown.  They loved seeing the old Corvette convertible  on display.  The old McDonald's also used to have cool displays of vintage McDonald's memorabilia such as Happy Meal toys through the years. That's gone now. You're supposed to be excited about the glass windows, a roof garden, phone chargerse and communal tables. These are things that you could literally see in every single country on earth. These are not things that are specific at all to the United States, to the Midwest or even to Chicago, the hometown (well, Des Plaines) of this beloved American chain.  And so, I suspect, this is the new way of the world. We forget our history, nostalgia is lost so we can all become boring and the same.

I told them ""I know the best McDonald's in the world and at this place we can Rock and/or Roll... or both"" and proceeded to take them to the location of the Rock n' Roll McDonalds we all know and love. When I felt the natural feeling of a warm fire and a home cooked meal I said to them ""We are here"" and they looked at me baffled...BAFFLED!!!! The homey, warm, inviting feeling was missing for them. Why was this feeling missing? Why didn't my friends feel the same feeling I felt?   Well when I came too, I realized that MONSTERS have torn down my beloved McDonald's. No more Rock n' Roll, no more Big Mac's. Allegedly  Rock n' Roll is dead in Chicago, we don't Rock and/or Roll, or either anymore. We just tear down monuments to those who Rock and/or Roll, or both. The glorious golden arches have come tumbling down, and with them Rock, Roll, and apparently Big Mac's.  The greatness that once stood in river north as a beckon for those who were down to earth, and liked to Rock and/or Roll (or both) no longer have a safe haven to run to.   I for one, will no longer Rock, Roll,(either) or eat Big Mac's in proximity of river north or Chicago until the one true home of Rock N' Roll (both), and Big Mac's has been brought back to its original  standing. This is not only an injustice to Rock, but also to Roll, and not to mention Big Mac's. How can someone like me that Rocks n' Rolls (Both) ever eat a Big Mac in this city knowing that there is not a single McDonald's that neither Rocks nor Rolls.

The service was slow, and I expected the food to be marked-up in the heart of the city (and it was) ... but the parking shake-down I was not expecting.   We spent about $13 for a couple of cheeseburgers, small fries and drinks ($13 for that, at a McDonalds?) and were in the restaurant for less than half an hour, but got charged $12 parking.  I complained to the attendant but he would not budge. He said the fee was because they were ""so busy"" on the weekends. Yet the lot and restaurant were not full at all, on a summer Saturday night...

So when I think McRib, I think about a boneless piece of pork rib on a bun. I was wrong! Did you know that the McRib contains 70 ingredients all restructured into one! What? Where's the Ribs? I feel like the ""Where's the beef lady?"" from Wendy's in the 80's. That sweet older lady knew her fun facts.   Did you know that the McRib is processed with 70 different ingredients which include azodicarbonamide which is a flour-bleaching agent often used in producing foamed plastics? Thats great now I know I can use a McRib when shipping my next package.   McRib's are basically ""restructured meat technology"" containing a mixture of tripe, heart, and scalded stomach. Wait...where are the ribs and what's a scalded stomach? My stomach is feeling scalded because I've eaten a few of these McThings in my lifetime. In fact, we should call every item on the menu a McThing.   Okay back to our Fun Facts: The proteins are extracted from this muscle mixture and they bind the pork trimmings together so they can be molded at a factory. The McRib is really just a molded blob of restructured meat, advertised and sold like fresh ribs. I guess the ""Mc"" part means fake.   There's nothing real about it, the preparation or the substance. In fact, McRibs really came about because of a chicken shortage. The restructured meat technology approach kept the McRib on the menu, despite the shortage, and the profits kept rolling in.   So you see what McDonalds cares about, they care about profits and not your health. How can any of this be classified as real food! It can't once you break any of it down.   This location is there flagship. I actually liked the old building better but they knocked it down. It had more character. This new location is just a super sized version of McDonald's.

I think the crispy club sandwich and jalapeno double went well together. I couldn't decide which one I liked better.  I like how the bag was big enough for me to put my trash in it at the end of the meal and service was so fast! The employee who took our order repeated things clearly after we said we couldn't hear them over the intercom. The employee who took our payment was courteous and mentioned that their system wasn't working properly when she stalled for a few seconds. She also asked what we ordered to make sure she was taking the payment for the right order (I'm assuming). The employee who gave us our order gave us our order and gave us a handful of ketchup when we asked if there was ketchup in the bag. There were no napkins in the bag, though.

One of my kiddos was devastated and his tears started welling up in his eyes and he wanted to leave right away. Ugh, that was the whole reason we went there in the first place - the fun upstairs with the funky seating areas, cool cafe, great views, and super fun mini museum.   Needless to say, we had to eat downstairs. No we didn't leave, but we were stuck in the *boring* part where our view wasn't as exciting, the place was pretty disgusting, the characters dining were awfully (and I mean awful) interesting, and the food was beyond overpriced.   When this place opened up, it was really exciting. It was clean inside and filled with other families out and about. Now it just feels like any old McDonald's, but no dollar menu or ice cream cones.

255,10/18/2013,3.0,"Oh McDonalds, the pride and joy of American fast food. Everyone should have stepped into a McDonalds at least once in their lifetime, but this is a special one. It is the flagship McDonalds in Chicago and for good reason: the location and it's amenities. Amenities you say? Don't think swimming pool or massage parlor, no. You will find a museum of McDonalds artifacts as well as collectibles from the early days of McDonalds up to the 90's. They also have a separate dessert section upstairs beside the museum as well as lounge-like seating. It's a very touristy version of the golden arches but I actually love going here when I visit Chicago.   They also have food but at high prices and the service isn't superb as you would think for a flagship store, hence the 3 stars. The value menu is not so much of a value, but it still gets a good amount of customers especially when you've found yourself starving after all the partying you've endured.

It is huge and has a ton of seats. The place gets packed with drunk people anytime past 1AM so try to go around that time if you're not drunk yourself. Also this McDonalds is freaky fast.

I armed my boyfriend with a $5 bill, and send him straight to the front of the line where the promise of ""keep the change"" convinced a random stranger at the front of the line to procure us the elusive drink.  2 lactaid pills and three straws later, the minty green flavor hit my lips and it was nothing short of glorious.  It completed my St. Paddy's Day experience, more than you'll ever know.

They also have a ""walk through the decades"" exhibit where they play music from each next to articles from that time period. In true VH1 fashion, the 00s are already represented.

This is where the horror begins.  They refuse to give us our keys unless we pay them $40 for the poinsettia plant that we supposedly ""destroyed"".  I was shocked.  I asked to speak with the store manager, Vicente, and he was completely unhelpful.    The worst part, was the guy holding us up for money was a cop!  He flashed his badge and said he was an off duty private police officer for Mcdonalds.  He and the manager just laughed at us pleading for our keys back.  I explained it was an accident; we stood the plant up after it fell.  The officer told me they had video footage of us ripping the plant apart.  I asked why the officer needed $40 in cash (which we didn't have) and he said it was to reimburse the plant.    ""Oh, the poinsettia plant that costs Mcdonald's .99 cents needs to be reimbursed, and giving a dirty cop $40 dollars will go straight to that, I'm sure!""  Needless to say this almost got me arrested.  But I avoided this by crying, exiting the building, and calling the cops myself.    When it was all said and done, my friends left the bar they were at to pay the crooked cop.  The cops arrived and didn't even get out of their car.  They said I should file a civil suit.  But the thing is, I don't care about the money.   (Even though my orphaned friend who only has $100 for christmas shopping used nearly half of it to save my ass.)  It's the principle of the thing.

Not so fast), so we decided to go into the trendy McDonald's and partake in our McFatties and sit in our Barcelona chairs while watching one of the many flat panel TVs broadcasting McDonald's propaganda.  After we purchased our Oreo McFatty and a 10-piece Chicken McNugget combo (~$8.00) we were informed that parking was not free, even though the sign clearly stated free in bold caps.  After going out to investigate the sign, I did notice in small print at the bottom of the sign after all of the hourly rates were listed, that there were some situations where the ""ONE HOUR FREE PARKING WITH A $6 PURCHASE"" did not apply, and sure enough Saturday night was one of them.  Though I was upset, I decided to let things roll and suck it up.  However as we were eating out food, we heard another group of men complain how they got ripped off with the parking, and we ran into another couple on the way back to our car that got ripped off by this misleading sign as well.  Finally, I decided to talk with the manager and let him know that his sign was misleading.  About 2 seconds after I started to talk to the manager, security arrived and rudely told me ""that I have to pay (for the parking).""  When I turned back around after getting barked at by security, the manager was gone.  Even more urked now, I tracked him down again and told him that I would be contacting the Better Business Bureau about his deceptive sign, and that he would hear from me again.  He shooed me away.  So, this is my first step in taking a stand against this McDonald's.  If you go here, beware of the deceptive parking tactics and the fact that they do not carry the Take5 McFatty (which is even worse than their deceptive parking tactics...hehehehe).  If you have been screwed over by this McDonald's (or any company for that matter), I encourage you to contact the Illinois Better Business Bureau and file a complaint, it actually does work.

There's only so much seating you can have, I thought. But lo and behold, I find a gelateria and mini museum upstairs! It was pretty nice, I have to admit. And they get extra points for offering something not so cookie-cutter with the gelato. I really liked the museum.

It's like Space Station Ronald McDonald or something. It's kind of a trip because it looks so modern but they serve the same garbage you can find at any other McDonald's.

This colorful list includes the Chicago's Great Ferris Wheel of 1893, the first Ferris wheel to be erected, hosting the opening game of the 1994 World Cup, and the invention of the zipper in 1894 to name a few.  Although the ground level of the magnificent eatery has ample seating, the second floor is where the majority of loyal and gleeful McDonalds patrons enjoy their mass produced madness. Varied races and nationalities that make up this modern day Ellis Island take the escalator to dine while sitting on an assortment of furniture from splattered from different time periods, including post-modern Eames style couches, make the perfect upholstery for devouring hamburgers, chicken McNuggets (who are now 'all white-meat'), and of course those classic milkshakes. Cleverly placed, the dessert section is conveniently situated upstairs as well, yet this is no ordinary dessert tray, as the selection includes ice cream, gelato, Starbucks coffee of many varieties, and t-shirts too, for the true tourist.   Along with pictures of McDonalds' locations in Argentina, China, Australia and plenty of other countries found on the walls upstairs, the translation of 'thank you' is written in a different language on every trash-bin found here. The melting pot, or rubbish-to-be-melted has never been so prevalent. My fellow cultural explorer strapped on his adventurer boots and set foot in line on path for a to a typical McDonalds dinner (although one may struggle to consider it such) in order to ""gain the full experience"". Making my way to the inviting red chairs in a more secluded area where I proceed to focus on the dancing man from the commercial who (after seeing the same thirty-second clip four times) I notice has a really neat bookcase in his upscale artificial apartment. Somewhere in between a stool and a counter chair, I feel an odd sense of comfort placing my backbone on it and before I allow myself to bounce on this chair with child like delight I mentally pat my discipline on the back, not even slightly tempted to eat anything created in this grandiose sterile environment. With ample lighting and an assortment of decorations, the eyes are constantly amused at Rock-n-Roll McDonalds.  Surprisingly, this particular McDonald's doesn't appeal directly to children as many often do. Apparently the frequent visitors of the area are not as enthusiastic over a jungle-gym or a corral full of plastic balls to jump on as they are enthused instead by history lessons, mediocre architectural blueprints, glass cases full of PEZ dispenser-heads and, possibly the most entertaining section of the entire Rock-N-Roll McDonalds: the decades room that glorifies pop culture artifacts from the last fifty years. In each five foot, or so, room the spectator not only gets to hear hit songs from the specific time period where they stand but are visually stimulated by a small assortment of things, actual things, that were popular at the time. From the 1950's, a moldy Mr. Potato Head (apparently back then they used an actual potato) is transformed from a potato to a man's face on a potato, as every Mr. Potato Head should be. Star wars figurines and videocassette recorders brandish the 1970's display whereas the 1990's room plays the 2 Unlimited song 'Get Ready for This' (recognizable by anyone who attended a sports event in the 90's) showcased also are an American Online floppy disk and a Furby doll. The display for the 2000's lacks anything of excitement except perhaps, a Harry Potter book and an American Idol calendar.   [IF YOUR GONNA READ ANY PARAGRAPH, READ THE FOLLOWING:]  Lame, I couldn't help concluding. Was any of this stuff ever exciting, or was it simply amusing for a short while for a select group of Americans that somehow dictated to the masses what should be remembered? Such is pop culture. It is called pop for a reason. For example, the pretty boys Milli Vanilli whose lip-synced songs rocketed them inside one of the many floating bubbles of pop culture, as they were ascending and enjoying their flight to stardom, their bubble suddenly burst when the truth was discovered, and it was short matter of time before they completely faded into oblivion. McDonalds, whose iconic artifacts themselves fit almost too perfectly in the time displays, have managed to overcome the bursting of bubbles and have now soiled themselves as one of America's longest living legends. The only other thing that could fit the title, of course, is rock and roll.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-chicago-178?osq=McDonald%27s&start=280

Approximately a week before that-I had ordered two coffees to go and while I was outside-an adolescent came up-grabbed one of the coffees and proceeded to drink it in front of me.  I just left and accepted the behavior.  Last evening Sunday, October 28, 2018-I placed three orders-one for a friend and two for me.  I ordered chicken tenders, burgers, apple pies, and two ice creams.  The crowd was huge at the pick-up kiosk and upon receiving one of my ice creams-I said that I had ordered it in a cup and not in a cone.  Some man in camouflage pants-just grabbed the ice cream cone from the McDonald's worker's hand and began to eat it while looking directly at me.  I just left and did not say anything.

From our table, about $15 worth of Food. Now I had 2 sandwiches, cousin, also  I believe he eats, kind of fast. I eat slow, So theirs a very RUDE, Security guard their. I've seen before tall dark, black guy. Now we weren't just sitting, not purchasing. He came 1st time shortly as we got their smiling, but phony, he said you gotta , purchase something, , hadn't been long got their. Now this McD, is just convenient, it has turned to a circus. I'm a senior tho, even tho don't look it,  So I said we didn't come here not to purchase, It's turn into a circus their, with sissy's and weirdo's starring. So the guard had smiled at me at 1st, and then when we sat down to eat, before I got finish. He was hurrying us again, and we're respectable, folks, not like the prostitute looking girls, and idiots, that you have to tell that to. He kept harassing us, hurry up, and eat, you gotta go. He said we'd been their for hours, and hadn't not hours, maybe 45-to hour. He act like we were supposed to run, out and wasn't finish eating, and got RUDE, saying I watched your bag while you, ordered, he said he was, and had walked away. I was watching anyway, from the front, looking back I said I'm gonna finish my sandwich, and will leave when I get threw.  I stand up for me, and he was harassing me cause I'm female and being very RUDE, an said I need to get my PUNK ASS, out of their.

He said you ought to be glad I watched your stuff. I said I'm not glad for nothing, I don't know who you think you are, talking to me like that. Yeah I can put you, out, yeah, you gonna get out. Now I wasn't rude at all, but defending me, I told him go some where with his minimum wage, job, acting like he's the POLICE, he said maybe I am one. I said no your not,  Couple of other words, not sure what else. That man grins, and smiles, at women, he's UGLY and big, and probably mad, cause he can't get a woman, I've seen him smiling, and looking at me, in a flirtatious, manner. I don't have time for that. Like I said people come in their all the time and sit, teenager's, it's a HOT spot for trashy kid's somewhat. POLICE was outside, I started to go abt my business, but I went to police car, and told them what he said to me, They said FILE a complaint with McDonalds, don't know what it will do but I will call later today.  Then he said I can get you banned from here. For what, he's a person, who wanna play BADASS, with folks, he picks, the wrong one's tho. They have some men, who, are abuser's , and wanna be looked up to.

She claims she called my number out but that's not possible since I was right next to the register waiting. Why lie if you forgot about someone's order? Again, today, I was at the register and my coupon wasn't scanning so they had to put it in manually. While we were getting that taken care of, the other employees were preparing my food. After they figured out the coupon issue, I paid and went straight to the counter, they already had my food ready and were annoyed that I wasn't there immediately (even though I was at the register paying the entire time), the girl says ""I've been calling you"", I told her I just finished paying and just got to the counter. After I got my food, I noticed she forgot to give me the sauce I ordered, I went up to the counter and nicely said ""hi, I had picante sauce with my order"", she looks at my receipt, throws the sauce in my back and walks away.

I ordered one of the restaurant's special signature sandwiches (I think that is what they were called) that was a quarter pound burger patty with honey Dijon mustard with bacon and onions. It was really good! I also had the option of ordering the sandwich as a chicken sandwich instead of as a hamburger that would still have all of the same toppings.  When using the self-order touch screens, you swipe with a credit/debit card into a small machine attached to the touch screens.

The irony of this specific McDonalds is that it is an exceptionally nice one both inside and out. It is ultra-modern with a great little outdoor garden with seats! I've never seen a McDonalds like this before.  Unfortunately it is absolute chaos inside. As some other reviewers have said, the staff have no control over it and it turns into a free-for-all. I honestly think Chicago PD needs to have a few officers staffed inside this place 24/7, since there are always a lot of sketchy things going on. I'm surprised no one has been stabbed and/or shot.  Even if you are just passing by, you will immediately know something is up with this place. There are no less than 20 strange characters loitering outside of it pretty much all day, making weird comments at strangers. Again, it's nothing short of a miracle that people haven't been stabbed or shot here. I make it a point to walk past as quickly as possible and not make eye contact since the people loitering out front always give me weird looks and act like they want to fight.

Its a downtown McDonald's at the crossroads of State and Chicago Streets at the entrance to the subway.     One word describes this McDonald's: busy. It seems that this McDonald's is marketed to the commuters exiting the subway and driving on Chicago Street with its giant arches hanging above the subway exit at Chicago Street. The result is that this McDonald's is busy. Even outside there are usually people hanging out, including the homeless.    This Mcdonald's is relatively large. There was no problem getting a table. And there was breathing room.    Because this McDonald's is busy and the employees were overworked while being on the friendly side, I will not dwell on the fact that they forgot my order and napkins. I will just knock off half a star.    This McDonald's is convenient, and relatively inexpensive. Whether its one or five stars, the convenience and ample seating makes up for the flaws.    Closing up this review, I have two tips.

516,7/25/2011,1.0,"Two points right out of the gate:   1. Thuggery knows no race (lily white frat boys from the suburbs can be just as vulgar and aggressive as any group with a gang mentality)  2. Rating a McDonald's and McDonald's food isn't really an essential service; people generally know what they're getting - menu and quality wise - going in.   The purpose of this review is mostly about the safety factor. People need to know (and I think locals already do) that, depending on the time of day (night), this place is marginally dangerous.   Over my last three visits to Chicago, I've noticed this neighborhood being overrun by flash mobs who do more looting, aggressive panhandling, and fighting than choreographed performing. In fact, this particular McDonald's had to be closed down for several hours a couple months ago while police attempted to restore order. The Water Tower Place Mall about a block away has seen an increase in gang activity lately, including the arrest of some armed teenagers.   This isn't just my take (check out some of the other reviews of this place and this neighborhood). Many are pointing out that the Mag Mile is slowly becoming the ""Mug Mile."" And this McDonald's seems to be ground zero for Hip Hop Nation as they pour off the Red Line after taking up two seats on the subway while grandma has to stand.   Apologists and the agenda driven will say (and have said): ""These kids are guilty of nothing other than being black in a predominantly white neighborhood."" Really? Since when does being authentically ""black"" include screaming nonstop obscenities with little kids around (black and white)? Since when did Chicago get so soft on youth crime? Since when did it become open season on civility?   [Since when did my reviews start reading like the rantings of some terrified reactionary/fascist?]   While it's mildly funny that Katelyn, Emily, Ashley, and their dolly buying mommies must sometimes contend with this thuggery after they leave the American Girl Doll store, nobody (not even the over-privileged, country club set) should have to endure this genuinely menacing behavior.

524,3/17/2010,1.0,"Today was the breaking point. Long ago, McDonald's revolutionized the restaurant industry with fast food dining, a paragon of what was possible when human ingenuity applied itself to streamline processes and deliver maximum production and food for people in the least amount of time. These days, efficiency no longer matters and has been replaced with indifference, complacency, and a lack of disregard to customer priorities.   On most mornings, I will stop into McDonald's to grab a yogurt parfait for $1.12 as my morning breakfast. I did it because it was a healthy breakfast, tasted good, and was amazingly cheap. Before today, one of the top ten things I associate with McDonald's is efficiency, and today I can throw that word out the window because McDonald's no longer merits it.  Today I left my house early for the express purpose of ordering more food for breakfast because I didn't have dinner and I was short on sleep and needed a giant coffee to go with some food to keep me sane for a long day at work. I arrived at 8:44am and I know this because Foursquare told me so when I checked in! Something was amiss and there was a large crowd of people and lines that were simply not moving.  Great, these things sometimes happen, which was why I was glad that I left my house early so that if I actually did have to wait in line it wouldn't matter and I'd still be able to get what I wanted when I wanted it. The minutes started flying by and the line still wasn't moving! What happened to that proud tradition of corporate efficiency to deliver the customer what they wanted when they wanted with the highest degree of professionalism and courtesy? Well you can all forget about it because it's clear that no one in this McDonald's during the morning shift gives one iota of care for anyone waiting in line.  I got to be the third person in line when two customers started to argue with the cashier that they wanted cream on the side of their coffee and not mixed in. The clerk wouldn't make a new coffee for the customers and the customers weren't having any of it. Watching these people argue with the clerk got my blood boiling because I was trying to get an order in and get to work on time!  Because of the inability of the clerk to placate these customers I ended up stuck in line waiting, waiting, and waiting in what seemed to be forever!  Having arrived at 8:44am, it was now 8:54am and I hadn't made an order! I yelled in frustration about the utter lack of disregard the staff had much to the amusement of the other patrons who were all either waiting for their order or waiting to order who all were in the same boat. I slammed the door on leaving and walked a block over to Starbucks.   At Starbucks I spent $5 for a giant cup of coffee and no food - $5 I could have easily spent at McDonald's in order to get what I wanted, but apparently McDonald's no longer cares about earning my money since they are too busy arguing with other customers and making everyone wait to order and wait for their food. Long gone are the good old days of the quick food restaurant, this McDonald's no longer adheres to any sense of time or service and has degenerated into the ultimate display of incompetency.

First, allow me to set the scene.  As an employee of a Gold Coast small business, I find it of utmost importance to arrive at work, refreshed and revived from the previous night's drinking shenanigans. McDonald's has consistently nourished me, in ways that other quick service establishments can only dream of.  Let's begin with their orange juice.  100% sugary, and not fresh squeezed - just the way I like it.  On to the second course - anything that comes on a muffin, or as I call them, ""little pillows of heaven.""  Add sausage, bacon, cheese, or eggs - the combinations are entirely endless...and delicious.  The McDonald's hashed browns are the perfect addition to any breakfast meal.  Greasy, soggy, salty, and amazing - no meal could be considered complete without them.  I guess what I am trying to say, in a blubbering, round-a-bout way, is that I don't know where I would be without McDonald's and their award-winning breakfast.  I owe more than my life to this establishment, and they are deserving of as many stars as Yelp will allow me to bless them with.

I happily went with her and, since the line was long, sat down at a table while I waited for her. It was taking a while for her order, so I started picking at my food from Chik-Fil-A but not outright dumping it out on the table to eat, just picking from the bag. However, from out of nowhere, an overly aggressive security guard came up to me to scold me. He told me that there were two McDonald's owners behind me and I was eating the competition's food and that was not allowed, which I understand. But he would not back off after my repeated insistences that I was simply waiting for my friend and that I would stop nibbling on my food. I also assured him what we were NOT staying in the restaurant but rather leaving as soon as my friend got her food. But that didn't satisfy him. He continued to loudly scold me for taking up seats (in a mostly empty restaurant, mind you).   My absolute favorite part about this McDonald's is that the only people the security staff cares about policing are people like me, clearly college students. No one ever does a thing about the vagrants that beg directly outside the door, the loud, aggressively preaching drug addicts inside the store, or the groups of teenagers that loiter outside. Nope. Not a thing. The only people that DO get harassed by security are those that the guard is sure he can intimidate.  I can assure you, unless you happen to be a homeless drug addict causing a scene or a teenage gangbanger up to no good, that you will be harassed in this location by security.

As anyone who has been in union station in the morning can attest, the place is a mad house.  Just trying to get in the doors around 9am is near impossible due to the flood of workers pouring off the trains and onto the street.  This McDonald's is much in the same.  It is an extremely high volume, high traffic place, but they have it down to a science.  Getting to the register and placing an order can be a little chaotic for first timers since this is not your typical ""stand in line, order, step to the side"" style.  Here, it's more of a free for all.  They have register next to register lined up, so the lines of people just become one big cloud.  The worker at the register rings out ""Next"" and half the time the person who is next does move, so someone else fills in.    After you find an open register and place your order, you have to about-face and weave your way through the crowd of people to wait for you food near the back.  So as you can begin to see how the order dynamic works, you can see how chaotic it can be.    Watching the workers behind the counter is fascinating.  To the untrained eye, it looks just as chaotic and crowded in the back, as it does in-front of the ordering counter.  However, if you are ever waiting on your food for more than a minute (that's how good these people are, under a minute, in crazy-busy times... consistently) you begin to see the well oil machine behind the counter.  Each person has a role, assembly line style, and although they may bump shoulders and knock elbows, they know what they need to do and get it done.

With that said, service is minimal here, you're better off carrying out food and eating elsewhere than trying to sit inside, and the food is made quickly, without much care put into the preparation.

The first thing that's annoying about this one is what everyone else says: it gets super crowded and is too small to handle the rush. The waiting area is just a few feet deep and there are self-ordering kiosks in the back, so it's hard to not block those while waiting.  That said, I do like the fact that they have those kiosks. It is nice to not have to wait in line sometimes. However, they are often out of order, and when they do work the UI is so slow and clunky that waiting in line would be faster.   Another gripe I have about this place is that they charge for extra sauce and condiments. They don't even have salt and ketchup sitting out, so you have to ask for it every time. Even then, they give you about four ketchup packets, which is not enough for even a kids size of fries.   I've begun to make coming here more tolerable by ordering through the app and picking it up, which makes getting in and out quicker.

It doesn't help that the staff doesn't seem to particularly care, but given the situation they are in, I can see how they'd get frustrated and/or fed up.

I had ordered the Dbl Qtr Cheese Meal with ketchup and cheese only.   Within a few minutes, I had received the order.  I was able to locate a table.   I guess the cooks dislike making special orders.... the cooks put so much ketchup on the burger to the point, where the ketchup is just oozing off of the burger.  The fries were on the colder side, so the fries were not fresh.  Since I was not a hurry, I just ate as much as I could.  The store is one the smaller side so the seating is more limited with various sizes of tables.  The  decor is okay.  The service is just like any other McDonalds.  As I was leaving, I noticed they offer a kiosk machine.  Maybe, I'll try that next time.",https://www.yelp.com//biz/mcdonalds-chicago-82?osq=McDonald%27s
625,12/24/2017,3.0,"It's a McDonald's and it was next to our hotel. It's basically exactly what I would expect. We stopped in for a quick breakfast on our last day in town because we didn't want to trek in the rain and we had coupons for a free Egg McMuffin from the Blackhawks game the night before.   You can either order from a kiosk in front or head to the registers - we opted for the latter. I got the free Egg McMuffin, minus the egg (weird, but didn't phase the cashier), a hash brown patty, and a yogurt parfait.   The cashier did have to wait for manager approval for the coupon, so that took awhile, but other than that it was smooth sailing. My order came out quickly and correct - key for those stopping in on their way to work.   The McMuffin was...McMuffin-y? I ended up peeling off the ham because I forgot a McMuffin came with one, and chowed down on my cheesy english muffin. The muffin itself was weirdly chewy. I wouldn't normally order this item but like free stuff; my boyfriend enjoyed his.   The hash brown was super fresh and one of the better ones I've had in my few McDonald's trips over the years. I'll be honest and admit I love their yogurt parfaits - it tastes like dessert but is somehow not super terrible for you in fat or calories. Sugar is probably where they get you, but you think that'd be a higher caloric content. I digress...  The interior is the newer design of wood/greys/etc. instead of the red/orange/yellow plastic of my childhood.

665,8/6/2014,3.0,"Coming back from a Chicago vacation, it is difficult to choose the places I wan't to review first. There are approximately 25 places from the Chicago vacation to review. To make this process less difficult I have written every one of these places on index cards. Before I write the review I shuffle the deck of index cards. The index card that appears is the place that gets priorty. Out of approximately 25 index cards, the State Street at Jackson Street McDonald's has shown up twice.     Using the deck of cards apology, you could say this business isn't playing with a full deck. Both the food and service is just ok.  My recent opinion of McDonalds is  their food is more suitable to hold you over until dinner. In current times, I see McDonalds as a snack. That's unless the McRib returns.The truth is there are far better fast food restaurants nearby that give much more bang for the buck. For example, a few blocks north on State Street, Chick Fil-A offers far tastier chicken nuggets with incomparable better customer service. Another example is that nearby Portobello offers far better hamburgers. I could go on and on.     This McDonald's stands in the shadows of DePaul, Robert Morris University, and the Chicago Library near the southern boundary of the Loop. This is a location that worked to our advantage on a day that we  walked the streets of the Loop. It had been awhile since breakfast and we needed a convenient snack to hold us over til dinner. Walking south toward the elevated train bridge fronting the Chicago Library, we saw the familiar Golden Arches sign. It led us to the convenient snack.    This McDonald's is nothing like the Chicago rock n roll McDonald's. It's neither upbeat or ghetto. It is a smaller urban McDonald's with a sports memorabilia theme. The sports memorabilia came in handy at the time of the slightly extended wait for the food. Friendliness at this McDonald's is yelling out ""#4"" or whatever order is ready. In my case it was the two cheeseburger meal. This is the least expensive meal on their menu. It was a good thing that I ordered it medium size taking into account that this McDonald's lacks the serve your own Coke machines. It was a better thing that this snack left room in my stomach for a tastier dinner.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-chicago-103?osq=McDonald%27s&start=0

I know that most people at McDonalds aren't happy to be working there, but really these people are miserable. I don't even know why they show up. What's the point?   The outside isn't particularly inviting. Neither is the inside. They really need to remodel. But the most uninviting aspect of this McDonald's location are the employees. I decided to write this review after my last visit. Last as in most recent, but it really will be my last. I ordered a Frappe and a McMuffin. The McMuffin came out pretty fast. But the Frappe... I waited. And waited. I saw the guy make other smoothies and stuff but no Frappe. When I finally asked the cashier, she went over to the guy and asked. That's when he made it. And when I asked him why he didn't make mine, he said, well that's the order of the drinks. Ummm why did everyone else who came after me get theirs first?

I just came from this location and did not check my order until I got back to work. The fries were cold and hard as if they had sat out all day, the Big Mac I ordered was ice cold and my drink was not correct. I paid for a large meal and got a small fry, and medium drink, which both are incorrect and none of the sauces I had paid for were in the bag. You may ask yourself how did they foul up so bad? Well it might've had to do with the fact the crew at this location was more concerned and focused on buying stolen merchandise from a homeless man then they were with doing their jobs. Every single employee came to see what this homeless man was selling instead of working so instead of 5 minutes to wait it was more like 10-15 for a order that turned out to be completely inedible and incorrect.

Randolph (name tag) insisted that I order my food first, THEN take it into a disgusting and quite small public restroom.    I don't really believe he personally liked this policy, because he looked completely embarrassed to repeat it, to his credit.   Was this ""policy"" decided to satisfy some sick criteria maybe to make sure that I wasn't a vagabond or loiterer?? It was absolutely insulting and harassing. I asked him ""are you seriously running up those other stairs (criss-cross design) to prevent a customer from using the restroom? Seriously?"" He nodded yes.   So I walked back down the stairs and asked a young man in a white shirt and bib was he a manager.    He said no and pointed to me to Maria who came over and listened to my complaint. She was respectful but told me that this store was a franchise and that nothing could be done even if I reported this to the corporate offices, etc.   She even said that all the McDonalds locations she knew of in the area had the same policy.   Well, my offices are just down the street from the flagship Rock and Roll McDonalds and there is another location at the Chicago River that's even closer. NEITHER of these locations has EVER done anything this insulting to me before.   ""NOTHING could be done"".    McDonalds is a global corporation and NOTHING could be done about this most insulting practice. I told her that my frustration was not personal and that it's a very bad policy and treats customers like garbage. At the end, I mentioned that I had no choice but to report this deplorable act and that I appreciated her listening to what took place.   There are a lot of homeless people who congregate near here and I understand that a store must be mindful of any activity that threatens its workers and customers, but in 20 years I've not seen ANY OTHER STORE near this McDonalds treat their customers in this derogatory way... so why the blanket and extreme decision to force an order first?

The register/line area is still a little hazy.  At times you'll have decent folk who can eye a register and form a line that runs parallel to that register.  It looks like a... LINE.  And then you've got the dumb-folk who will amass in a CLUMP as near a register as possible and it makes for awkward determinations of ""who's next"".  Sometimes I really feel for the McDonald's crew...  Luckily, they now have this new system where there's a LINE area, and a separate WAITING area.  It's a specific area with a flashy HDTV thing that will pop up your ticket number by a little counter area where they are loading up the completed orders.  So they're no longer trying to hand out food by the registers where people are waiting to order AND waiting to pick up their order, causing a larger CLUMP MESS.  The seating area is pretty spiffy-looking now too, though I don't really eat in the location.  But I have used the restrooms, and - for a McDonald's - they're pretty clean.  The one thing I know about this location is that there's ALWAYS a Security Person there.  I'm hoping it's just to keep the beggars at a distance (all 3 feet away from the entrance doors), since I haven't found a beggar inside (except to buy Dollar Menu items, not actively panhandling) and I really haven't seen them do much other than eye people suspiciously and basically stand there.  What else is there to review?  The food?  That's barely something you can attribute to one location rather than the entire franchise.  I can't give them auto-5-star ratings just because it's the time period where they have McRibs in stock.  My only complaint is that I typically make some big orders, and it can take a LONG LONG TIME to get those out.  It sucks being ticket #315 and seeing/watching everyone up to #320 get their food before mine comes out.

I thought I would give this place a try on a Sunday around noon as I wanted to grab an inexpensive bite to eat.  I wanted to sit for a while, check out the wi-fi and read.  However, this was my experience:  I walked in and saw what appeared to be 4 lines with 5-7 people in each line.  I stood in what I thought was a line only to find out these were people who already placed an order and were waiting to pick it up.  No one behind the counter seemed to be directing people to where the lines were (especially with 6 registers but only two were in use).    Next, I go to the end of a line, wait again to get to the unenthusiastic cashier who dryly took my order and as soon as my credit card was swiped LEANED AROUND ME to ask the next person for their order - now I see why people are randomly waiting around the counter for their orders.   While I waited in line, I was approached by TWO different panhandlers requesting money for the bus or asking me to buy them food.  One of the main reasons I don't go to this location is because of the 4-6 panhandlers that surround the entrance - now they are inside as well.  The staff seemed only to be annoyed and didn't bother to ask them to stop begging from everyone in the line (one even stood by the counter!)   I finally received my food and went to find a seat in the dining area.  There were several places to sit, but most of them had trash on the table top or at minimum leftover food and hadn't been wiped down.  I found the least dirty spot (one with dried tobacco from where someone had been rolling cigarettes!) and sat there. I was then approached by another panhandler asking for money table-by-table in in the dining area.    Not that I have high-expectations for McDonald's food - especially from the dollar menu - but the bread on my sandwich seemed crusty - as if it had been sitting exposed to air for too long.    After all of these experiences I had no desire to stay any longer than it took to eat (and of course the trash cans were filled to capacity.).   I debated talking to the manager, but felt it was the reasonable thing to do.  The counter was empty with the exception of a couple who just received their order.  I had to speak up for someone behind the counter to acknowledge me standing there and I asked for the Manager.   I reported what I saw to her and she said that they had more guests than usual in the store today and how she normally cleans the lobby herself.  I can understand that, but her tone and quick apology felt more like a required response than it did an attempt to hear out a dissatisfied customer. I think if I had been speaking in unknown tongues I would have received the exact same response. :(   So, I put this out as a warning to anyone in the loop - MOST of the McDonald's restaurants down here are sub-par.  If you must have McDonald's try the one further north on Wabash between Randolph and Washington.  Be forewarned though - they don't participate in the dollar menu and have somewhat nicer panhandlers outside.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-chicago-103?osq=McDonald%27s&start=40

722,7/5/2011,4.0,"Well here we have a McDonald's restaurant.  Although it is technically a ""local"" business (based in Oak Brook), there are over 32,000 of these worldwide, making it sorta, well... not local.  The goal of McDonald's is ""consistency"" - in other words, a Big Mac should taste the same in Bangor as it does in Sausalito.  A Filet-O-Fish the same in San Diego as in Rochester, and so on.  McDonald's, then, should be judged on that basis along with service quality and cleanliness.  With that in mind, this ""Mac Shack"" fares reasonably well.  It's a little hole in the wall on McClurg Ct. between Ontario and Erie and, as is the case with most urban ""Mickey D's"", has no drive through.  It is located strategically between Northwestern University's Chicago campus and the bulk of residential high-rises in the Streeterville and River East neighborhoods so it gets a lot of carry-out business during your standard dining periods.  The dining room itself is rarely all that crowded.  The food is pretty consistent with the bulk of the other McDonald's that I've visited throughout the course of my life.  I've never had a ""bad"" meal there, which is all one can really ask.  Occasionally the food is actually really good, which is a bonus but should never be the expectation at any McDonald's.  As for service quality, the staff is generally amicable and the food is prepared at around average speed.  The dining room is generally clean and the condiment station stocked.  In the end, this is a pretty good McDonald's by comparison to other McDonald's.  Of course if one is to compare it to, say, a local one-off hamburger joint, it's gonna fare pretty poorly, but in this reviewers opinion, that's comparing apples to oranges.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-chicago-123?osq=McDonald%27s&start=0

The most recent thing that has happened is something that would seem inane, however, makes a huge difference to me.  McDonalds recently rolled (ha) out a limited edition Rollo McFlurry.  I am a Rollo nut.  So I tried it the first day it was out and loved it.  It is basically ice cream mixed with chocolate pieces and caramel.  much like Rollos.  As I said, the first one was glorious (from this McDonalds).  I have been back twice.  Each time, no caramel.  This is an integral part of the McFlurry.  And to add insult to the whole thing, when I went to McDonalds this evening to get said McFlurry, I was waiting in the drive thru and I sat waiting and watching as my McFlurry was sitting on the counter inside the window and no one was there to give it to me.  I sat for 5 minutes, even honking my horn as 2 other employees walked by, neither of whom made eye contact.    This is one incident.  As I said,  there have been several instances where employees have been rude (one including an employee telling that I HAVE TO use a cup holder when I asked that she not give me one-I don't like to waste things).",https://www.yelp.com//biz/mcdonalds-chicago-216?osq=McDonald%27s

813,8/5/2012,3.0,"Downtown Chicago visitors love the Navy Pier and it's McDonald's. The result is a hyper-crowded McDonald's a short distance into the Navy Pier.     Despite the hyper-congestion, it is a good McDonald's. The upbeat ""McDonald's to the Future"" theme is cool (I don't get how it fits the theme). When I visited this past Sunday, there were plenty of employees taking orders. The lines moved fast. After placing your order, you wait to the left of the register. This alleviates confusion.    There are plenty of indoor and outdoor tables. What I enjoyed about the Navy Pier McDonald's was sitting outside enjoying a Coke and fries while watching people and boats. After awhile, it did get slightly annoying hearing tour boat employees yelling out tour boat prices to passers-by.     The Navy Pier McDonald's has some disadvantages. It shares a restroom with the attached mall.  I had to wait on a line to use the restroom. The prices are inflated. The $1 menu and $1 large Coke was nonexistent.    I recommend the Navy Pier McDonald's for a light snack to hold over your appetite for a better meal later in the day.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-chicago-20?osq=McDonald%27s&start=0

The order took so long that by the time I received my breakfast it was lunch time. 5 others at least received their lunch before I received my breakfast. Oh, by the way, my order was wrong and had to send it back. The lines were not very busy but there was chaos. Overweight attendants were not moving very quickly and all you could hear were people people yelling at each other as too why food wasn't being prepared.  I didn't like that after the meal was packed attendants were reaching back in the bags and moving food around after handling money. This was by far the worst experience and will never buy a meal there again. Your workers do not reflect your commercials. Most locations receive you with a smile regardless of what may be going on behind the scenes. At Navy Pier, the workers act as if we are bothering them.

818,2/1/2012,4.0,"McD's!  Really?  I'm going to review a Mc D's?   Here's why.  Now let me clarify a few things.  This is the McDonald's at Navy Pier, Chicago.  One of the most visited tourist attractions in the Country.  This isn't your neighborhood McDonald's or an off the highway McDonald's.  This place is packed and it's always packed.  Let me also say, I am in the hospitality profession and I know just a little bit about the restaurant business.  And I am a mom and I know alot about what and how kids like to eat.  For the sheer volume of food this place puts out, they run it like a well oiled machine.  Does it look like chaos, maybe.  There are hundreds of families with strollers and screaming toddlers and obnoxious tweens-OF COURSE IT LOOKS LIKE CHAOS!  Everyone is tired and hungry and sugared up.  And this place will serve you the same sandwich you know and love-though you won't admit it-the same sandwich that you can get in any town in America and arond the world.  And they will serve you and a dozen other families simultaneously in less than 5 minutes and for less than $7 per person.  And they will do it with a smile. That is impressive!  Now I've spent twice as much money at other Navy Pier eateries but I've rarely got twice the quality, and it takes alot longer and your kids won't like that and therefore you will be miserable.  Or try getting one kid one thing from one fast food place and another kid something else at another place.  See how long that takes you.... No, I recomend Mc D's.   But let me say this.  If I find myself at Navy Pier on business, sans kids.  No.  I will not come here.  But it is impressive how fast those workers move and I think they deserve 4 stars for that.

847,12/26/2016,4.0,Fast food is fast food and when done right it can be rather tasty. I love this McDonald's location. Their service is fast and reliable whether it be drive thru or dine in. Dined in for the first time today and found their holiday decorations very inviting. The tables even had fresh flowers in a small vase on them. I thought that was a nice touch and was something I had not seen before. The employees are pleasant and fast. The food is always fresh in the sense that it hasn't been sitting under a heat lamp all day.  You can definitely tell the employees are proud of what they do and it's exemplified through the food and service.

Over 3 years ago during the summer maybe July I was at my grandmas at the time and we then decided to go to McDonalds and I'm not kidding it was about 2am or so! And all of us were there, cousins, etc. so we go into the drive thru, I think like there is only like 1 girl there and we order a lot but not too much for my 2 cousins, aunt, grandma, uncle, dad. A lot! So this girl she's getting our orders and literally we got the rat about 3am we stood waiting until 4am nearly maybe an hour and a half then we get our food! Crazy! But I do think it was unfair to make that like teenage girl work a really long shift alone! Forreal!

So when we go up to the window my mom then asks for a soda because she forgot to say it at the speaker.(I think) Then she says what kind of cup. My mom says kids cup. Then she says ""Well..kids can't drink pop!"" My mom says ok and we leave with our food. Like is that ANY of your business to say who could drink what?!  After that we went another time and when went, she was there again, my stepdad said ""Now you can't get pop.

We ordered 2 McChickens, 10 piece Chicken nuggets and large fries. We got our order about 15 min later and we open the bag and the whole order was wrong. We got an artisan grilled chicken sandwich with the fries. So we called McDonald's to get a solution and the manager in charge LUCIO, was very very rude. We explained the situation and his response was, ""I can't do anything because Uber Eats picked it up so it's their problem."" Like how is it Uber Eats problem. We continued to discuss and he told me he couldn't leave the store because he was the ONLY one there. He couldn't give us our refund or meal unless we drove there. Dude it was 1am! I was pissed and annoyed so I drove because it wasn't fair to my sister to loose the $15 charged for a meal we didn't get. I get to the drive up window and there are 3 other people in the building. I even repeated to him about what he initially said and he didn't respond to me. He gave me my money back but only $12. I informed him I was going to talk to the district manager because they happen to be a very close family member to me. This isn't the first time it an issue has arose here. The way he handled it was very unprofessional. Didn't give us a solution nor tried to pursue one. I've never had a horrible experience and it horrifies me that there are managers like this around.

But this won't be about the food as much as it is about the franchizee's choice of decor (furniture, colors, flooring, etc.). For THAT, it gets probably a 5; it's adult and high-style, but cool and colorful for the younger customers or tag-alongs to customers. You will be surprised at how non-cookie-cutter the tables and chairs (some being particularly comfortable padded stools) are.  But you'll see that after you order and receive your food, which is fairly standard McDonald's fare (Although I have to say that the ""Daily Double"" burger that I got was very well made - fresh but lofty). You could have photographed it (but that would draw some attention). This franchisee chose to have the all-video menus screens mounted above the front service area, the items for that hour rotating in a smooth and orderly, easy-to-read presentation.  The stools mentioned above are upholstered in colors that will remind you to perhaps order a parfait for dessert - strawberry red and blueberry purple. the tables are white and light gray. Over a floor of dark slate gray and supports (for tables and stools) of brushed silver, you get a soothing modern backdrop for your small meal.

She doesn't like any of the food that she liked before. My mother was sure she was at the end of her life several times when my grandmother stopped eating. My mother finally discovered my grandmother's love of McDonalds fish sandwiches and since August, my uncle has been going to this specific McDonalds on the west side of Chicago to get my grandmother a fresh fish sandwich everyday. McDonalds Today, 11/6/18 my uncle did like he always does and walked to the nearest McDonalds to get my grandmother her fish sandwich. He came back home empty handed. When asked by my mother where her mother's fish sandwich was, he replied, they wouldn't sell it to me without buying a meal. My mom kind of laughed because surely he was joking. She said what do you mean? He said they told him they only had fish sandwiches for fish meals. So my mother, who just had surgery and is on crutches, had her neighbor take her to the McDonalds to talk to the manager. The manager, who was a young kid refused to listen to my mother. He kept interrupting her and asking who did it which my mother didn't know because of course she wasn't the one who ordered the initial sandwich. He tried to dismiss her and rush her out. He offered no apology. My mother had to go to another McDonalds to get my grandmother's sandwich so that she could eat today.

900,4/26/2018,1.0,"I normally don't write reviews but I just feel compelled too. this mcdonalds has terrible service, terrible employees, long lines inside and drive thru, disorganization, and kiosks that are never on. I have read all the reviews and all the bad ones are spot on! I visited this location on 4/25/18. I ordered food for my husband and myself. the kiosks weren't working as usual (they have 4) so they tell you place your order at the counter. the disorganization comes into play here there is not a designated place to stand in line everyone's just all over the place. one person at the counter was taking orders and then this other girl comes up being really ignorant and talking about another employee and has a major attitude and saying ""I don't know why they got me here and other stuff"" I'm thinking to myself as a customer ""I don't wanna here that and if you don't like your job or can't handle it find another job.""  it was my turn to place my order and the girl said so rudely and low like i was bothering her ""yeah can i help?"" I place my order and I wait but as I'm waiting other people order and getting there food before me and another customer I had been waiting for my food for 15 mins so I finally say something and get the manager and I tell her I been waiting and people who came in after me who ordered food was served before me. she apologized evidently my order was cleared off the board without even being prepared. so I had to tell her my order and then the girl who took my order comes and says my order because she remembered it. she had to tell the manager like 3 times what my order was. I'm not mad at the manager until I have to come back because food was left out of my order. when i got my food the first time it was not fresh at all but whatever. I am giving two apple pies for the wait. when I get home I noticed two Mchicken were not in the order. so I go back and wait in line again when I asked to speak to the manager she remembered and she apologized again and gave me my food but what made me mad was you didn't offer anything for the inconvenience of having to leave food at home and not being able to relax and eat with my husband to come back out for a mistake that they made despite the order being repeated to you twice. not to mention I saw a girl from the back come up to the front with no hair net on and she was scratching in her head and she was not wearing gloves. that is gross and disgusting and cross contamination will occur. I woke up this morning not feeling well my stomach has been hurting and been very nauseous I was perfectly fine until I eat my McDonald's which I made sure it was hot and Verlie heated to get rid of any germs may have gotten on the not so fresh food. This McDonald's location either needs to have new employees or it needs to be closed and I'm surprised that the owner has not read the reviews on yelp or Google because they are really destroying his business and livelihood. I will say this McDonald's is run predominately by African-Americans and me being mixed with African-American in him this location embarrasses me. This location is very ghetto and dirty you have people bugging you and asking you for money while you're standing in line trying to mind your own business and place an order for food. Everybody talks about one in $15 an hour to work before McDonald's but honestly you only deserve about $6 for the majority of the employees that work here. this is just my personal opinion but some people look upon the actions of what one black person may do and view that as everyone in that race will do that; which is not true but if people were to come to list location I can understand why some people would think that but we are not all like that just like in any race there are non-intelligent ignorant people and that represents that person not the whole race. I'm not trying to make this into a racial thing but I've noticed that some McDonald's that have predominately African-Americans workers usually sometimes have the most negative reviews. i don't know if it's from lack of training or some stores don't care about who they hire as long as they have a body to work. I will say sometimes it seems like if you have an attitude, treat people like crap, and have no type of customer service skills you are hired! I mean look at the reviews they speak for themselves. Not to mention there was another customer who complained as I was leaving the second time that there is no line and that the employees are too busy talking to each other instead of helping the customers and keeping the restaurant clean and working order. I feel that more kiosks need to be put up and get rid of the counter people and let people order from the kiosks or in drive-through. i will never return to this location i'd rather go out my way to the oak park location and be treated with respect and feel like i'm not bothering them by coming in.",https://www.yelp.com//biz/mcdonalds-chicago-75?osq=McDonald%27s

I do not judge hard on service as I understand that it's difficult to work at a fast food restaurant. But this is by far the worst McDonalds I have ever been to. The cashiers are far from friendly and have no initiative to service customers. From what I understand, the cashiers are responsible for fulfilling the drink orders for each customer they service. My cashier was extremely slow. She filled three other drink orders for people that she rung up after me. After I kept asking for my drink, another person finally decided to help out. 2. I got charged $9.11 for an egg white delight, orange juice, and two hash browns. Typically this order is in the $6 range. Instead of making my order a ""meal,"" she charged me individually for everything! When I asked her why it was so much, she said it was too late to adjust it since my card had already went through. I was in a hurry and told her I did not have time to dispute the charge. 3. They are not meeting there drive thru time standards. Cars are piled up around the corner.

They will not fail to give you painfully slow service, unwelcoming interactions, and messed up orders. At least they are consistent...  There's been a few times I'd drive by, thinking I would do a late night McD's run, just to see all the lights turned off. Why are all the lights turned off?

The owner created a Black Heritage theme with an emphasis on the Civil Rights Movement within this establishment. Framed newspaper articles, Jet and Ebony cover pages from the 1960's help to create a very mural that details the Movement.  It is a  very classy, subtle educational artpiece which includes photos of Martin Luther King, Jr., Coretta Scott King, Jesse Jackson, Ralph Abernathy, Julian Bond and many other Civil Rights leaders.  This McDonald's has been remodeled in recent years and the seating arrangement and set up are wonderful.  Its located on Martin Luther King Drive, right at the Stevenson Expressway and in the vicinity of Mercy and Michael Reese Hospitals.  The Bronzeville statue is right at median near this McDonald's.   Now, in terms of service, they know they are in a strategic location and the service is of a very high quality. The drive-through is efficient and counter service always has a good number of workers so, even though it is a very busy restaurant, you do not have to wait a long time as the workers are courteous, well trained and organized. This is one McDonald's that I recommend you ""order-in"" for a wonderful educational exposure to Black Heritage / Black History in the United States.

1056,4/8/2014,4.0,"There's a few things about this McDonald's that get me down. First, like many McDonald's they don't seem to care who sits in their booths or for how long. Many times I've gone in, and seen the booths all filled, one customer a piece, nursing only a small coffee, but clearly in it for the long haul reading a paper, staring vacantly out the window, or going through one of their bags of belongings. I feel bad for these folks as they don't seem to have anywhere to go or anywhere to be, but sometimes it would be nice to find a booth for my family. It's okay, it's like that in McDonalds around the country, maybe the world, it's just annoying how often it happens.   Another annoyance, as of a few months ago at least, they were employing some jackass to sit in their car all day to monitor whether or not people were parking in their lot then going elsewhere, ready to pounce and give them an expensive boot. So beware, you will most certainly be booted if you even go next door for a second. Crappy business practice in my view but whatever, it's their place. Before they employed this goon I've never seen the lot completely full ever, so I'm not sure what happened. From what I understand though this boot company approaches businesses with an offer to monitor their lot, and perhaps give McDs a cut of the profits I don't know. That's vulture capitalism for you. Hopefully this kind of practice will be outlawed some day but for right now they've got a zero tolerance policy.  The food here is standard, nothing special, nothing gross. The staff is always courteous, if not friendly. They've messed up my order many times when I've come through the drive through, but isn't that normal for McDonalds?  It's usually fairly clean though they do seem to have trouble cleaning off the unused tables sometimes. Maybe they're just completely surprised when a table is vacated.

First, this McDonalds is already too slow. Nowadays, everyone pays with their debit card or credit card, which would mean that they would slow down the service even more.

I went there about 1 pm on a Thursday afternoon.   One thing I absolutely LOVE about McDonalds is their french fries. Not this time! They were cold, soggy &amp; 1/2 empty: yes, I am a pessimist when it comes to my fries. The girl behind the counter selected amongst a bleacher full of old fries and chose the least full for me.   Another of my specialties is double cheeseburger, add bacon. This trip was the very first time I have ordered a burger where the bun was soaked with grease. I'm beginning to think they absolutely hate it when I ask them to add bacon...   The counter girl was also kind enough to give me lukewarm Coke with no ice.   atmosphere: it's a teeny bopper playground. I also tried laying my tray amongst the washclothes &amp; supposedly ""clean"" stack of those paper things they put on your trays.... it was sitting above the garbage.

A friend of mine was three orders back and it took a full twenty minutes to get his order filled ( two chicken wraps ). Insane! You'd think we were at a sit down restaurant waiting so long and even after all that time, his order was incorrect.

On another occasion, food I ordered (drive-thru) for a car load of hungry little ones was met with two ice cream cones and a nice exit greeting of ""Have a nice day"".  Again not my order.    The problem seems to be that everyone working that window is having a great time at work.  So great, that orders are often ""messed up"".  It would be conceivable that all of these reviews and my occurrences were recent.  But my visits are over a span of time dating back two years.  On two occasions I've shared my thoughts with management in person and over the phone.  Free food is great and all but the hopes it doesn't keep happening is what customers desire.  Management needs to get their window workers &amp; support staff in check.  This location can be a headache to get back to if you pull away without checking your order, especially during rush hour and cars are bumper to bumper.  ALWAYS CHECK YOUR ORDER.",https://www.yelp.com//biz/mcdonalds-evanston-2?osq=McDonald%27s

1232,1/7/2018,1.0,"I've been ordering from this location for several months and let me tell you.... 1st of all I demand FRESH FOOD all the time when I order. If it's not, I GIVE IT ALL BACK ! I'm happy to say they've done an excellent job because the foods been fresh, tasty and the service spot on.  Here's some good advise, any restaurant that has its fountain drinks in good working order and tastes like it's suppose to (ie) just opened a new can of that soda, its a good bet the food will be equally as good. Its a great measuring stick sizing up the service and food.  This McD's fountains are always 100% prefect.     Most of the time the tables are clean as well as the washrooms. Most of the workers are polite.  My only gripe is to probably avoid the drive thru late night because I did get cold food, missing food, as well as large fries being filled half way so the quality control is lacking at night which accounts for a 4 instead of 5 stars.  *******Update*******  My girlfriend and I visited this place past midnight 1/7/18 to eat in but left because about 10 black kids stormed the restaurant and started shouting as if they were in the gym at school. I asked the lady manager to ask them to please quiet down as to not disturb the customers. She looked at me clueless, looked at the order taker and just rudely ignored the request. Further more, these blacks gathered right in front of the doors blocking the entrance. Again the manager with short hair wearing​ eyeglasses acted like she didnt have a care in the world. Her job as manager is to make sure the customers have a pleasant experience. In this case it was quite the opposite.  Furthermore 2. My order was half wrong, called the number on the receipt​ to complain.  Nobody picked up.",https://www.yelp.com//biz/mcdonalds-melrose-park?osq=McDonald%27s
1233,10/24/2018,2.0,"Went here on 10/20/18 order 2 meals,  2 Big Macs &amp; 1 large fry 1 large drink. 2nd order was the same no large drink.   1st order came up right away, 2nd order had to wait for the fries. They had 8 or 9  workers there. 1 of them said sorry just a minute for the fries. They kept forgetting  to drop the fries. after 6 minutes I said I will come back  tomorrow after they still didn't drop them. I went back on Monday 10/22/18 for my fries I never got for which  I paid for. I order 2 Big Macs for $6.00 since I had a coupon &amp; a large drink. I had the coupon in my hand when I told the girl. I notice they charged me full price for the Big Macs even though I told the casher &amp; showed her the coupon. I asked for the correct change she said sorry the signs said no refunds !. I didn't make the mistake. So I walked out without my money or food ! I had to call McDonalds 800 number to get it straighten out. I don't think it should have gotten to that point.",https://www.yelp.com//biz/mcdonalds-melrose-park?osq=McDonald%27s

1235,2/2/2018,1.0,"The employee was cleaning garbage cans, removing trash, sweeping, spraying tables then without washing hands picking up orders and bringing the tray to people's tables including mine. Then he went to clean the bathroom. I told the manager, she asked for my order number, said ok and did nothing. He proceeded to clean and bring food.   If they want to have table numbers they need a dedicated server. This is absolutely disgusting and the lack of concern or acknowledgement is worse. I'm calling the health department.",https://www.yelp.com//biz/mcdonalds-melrose-park?osq=McDonald%27s
1236,3/12/2017,4.0,Convenient and large McDonald's.  Well managed venue and well prepared food.  We stopped in for breakfast.  They were quick to prepare our order.  The staff here is as good as it gets by fast food standard.,https://www.yelp.com//biz/mcdonalds-melrose-park?osq=McDonald%27s
1237,3/20/2016,4.0,"As McDonald's go - this is a fairly decent place. I've always had prompt, polite service going through the drive-though and my orders have come out fine and correct. The receipts say it's owned by the O'Donnell family I believe - if these are the new owners, they're going in the right direction.   Can't testify to the indoor experience as I've not needed to go inside, but as long as their drive up continues to satisfy and as long as I'm still driving - I'll stop in here now and then.",https://www.yelp.com//biz/mcdonalds-melrose-park?osq=McDonald%27s

1239,11/9/2011,1.0,"I went to the drive thru today like I do most days that I work. When I pulled up and paid, a lady brought my food to the manager working the drive thru. The bag fell and the manager tried to give it to me. I asked if he was serious and he daid thst it was OK because rhe bag feel upright on the floor. I asked for different food and he walked away with the dirty food and came back with a new bag. I assumed the food was the same so I took it and threw it out when I got to work. I called and talked to a different manager and she couldn't have cared less.   NEVER GO HERE!!!",https://www.yelp.com//biz/mcdonalds-melrose-park?osq=McDonald%27s
1240,9/15/2009,2.0,"Kind of dumpy, playland closed and locked when we first got there, eventually someone came out and unlocked it (late breakfast hours).  Nice graffiti scrawled inside the tubes, not well-maintained.  They had a little trouble getting our order straight, though I'll give them credit because it was probably a bit more complex than ""two number 1's and a number 2"".  The general atmosphere was one of not really caring.  Not impressive, but not the worst ever.",https://www.yelp.com//biz/mcdonalds-melrose-park?osq=McDonald%27s
1241,2/25/2008,1.0,"Driving past this place on the way for a quick stop at Menard's, my 4 year old son pointed out this McD's has a Playland. Since we had time to kill before having to be someplace else, we decided to stop in here for a while.  Located across from Maywood Park next to the Denny's, this is a very popular location, so we thought it might be a good one. To sum it up: one of the dirtiest McDonald's I have ever visited. The Playland seating area had a sticky floor where your feet are glued to the tile when you sit down. Just looking around the rest of the restaurant seating area, there's straw wrappers all over the floor, bits of food, and no idea what it's like in back.  A lot of the kids in the play area were kind of obese for their age. The biggest boy, maybe 7 or 8, had very grubby hands and the slide shook when he went down.   After about 45 minutes of intense playing, we thought it's best to wash our hands. Well, there was no soap in the bathroom and 1 of the 2 toilet fixtures was out of order. Lucky we didn't order food or it would have been an unhappy meal.",https://www.yelp.com//biz/mcdonalds-melrose-park?osq=McDonald%27s
1242,2/21/2009,4.0,"Um, it's McDonald's... What do you expect?   I don't have kids, didn't use the play area, but went in on a rainy winter Sunday morning, and had a just fine time. I wouldn't normally rate McDs, but I feel it deserves better than the 1 star it got below.   Our food was hot, my McCafe drink was good, and other than one loud customer ... it was fine. Lots of older folks having coffee, reading their paper. I didn't use the bathroom, and also know better than to think I'm getting a clean table when I eat in at McD's.",https://www.yelp.com//biz/mcdonalds-melrose-park?osq=McDonald%27s

Mind you I was sitting with a 2yr old an my mother. I was like are you serious. The food was made sloppy, the snack wrap sauce was just dabed on the tortilla I was like are you serious the cookies were hard as rocks, the big mac sauce is just thrown on that its on top of the bun.

1245,11/17/2013,4.0,"Now what exactly is on number twelve?  This time I was getting a treat for that son of mine who drops in ever so often. I was out early in the morning and knew that he'd still be snoozing when I returned, so I thought why not surprise him. I don't know why he prefers the taste of McDonald's to mom's home cooked meals... I always used to cook when all six were home - everything was homemade; the cookies, breads, bagels, meals from scratch, ... Maybe my dears just want something not so healthy...  Well, it was number twelve, but what was a number twelve. The young lady taking my order explained it well however, upgraded my drink to a medium coffee when I didn't ask for it. Not that I'm a penny pincher; much... I just don't like a company taking mine without my permission. It was, after all either eleven or seventeen cents, that I didn't want to spend. So when I drove around to the payment window there was a patient young man who further explained the what and why of the drinks. He gave me what I asked for and waited while I counted out my pennies :-) He wasn't upset or anything, just patient. This was impressive. Of course, had it been later in the day after the umpteenth penny counting old lady, would he still be as patient?  God only knows; but at the moment he was impressive. So the service was good, the food - my son was thankful and enjoyed it, and the coffee was tasty and I'm still using the cup :-)",https://www.yelp.com//biz/mcdonalds-maywood?osq=McDonald%27s

The differenxe between the regular buttermilk chicken sandwich and the signature. With increasing volume my cashier said ""the recipe is different"" but couldn't answer how it was different.  Well, one has a sauce containing something I am incredibly allergic to... So if I'd order that the risk of my throat closing was pretty high.  When a manager rang in my different order after explanation she didn't give me a receipt and overcharged me.
