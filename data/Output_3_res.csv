1,8/15/2018,3.0,Not the best experience today. If I order at the kiosk I ASSUMED it would be faster. It usually is. Not today.  I purchased water and a sandwich.... it sat there. While the manager was helping a cashier count out a patrons changed-all coins. I believe the cashier needed help with the nickels and dimes. But I am on a 30min lunch. Why does it take 2 pol to count change in nickels and dimes?. An off day for my fav McDonalds.,https://www.yelp.com//biz/mcdonalds-chicago-199?osq=McDonald%27s

3,2/7/2018,5.0,"I love this McDonald's, mostly because you can order at the self-service kiosk, which doesn't take cash (but who carries cash anyways). When you eat in, the staff bring your food to you and have always been polite and friendly. Today, they even gave me a cup of water without me asking.   This location has always been clean when I visit and they even put up seasonal decorations.

5,3/28/2018,1.0,"Stop by McDonald's at 203 N. LaSalle this morning for breakfast.  Upon arriving security was harassing an individual about whether he bought his own food or not.  He was trying to explain that he paid for his own food, but I guess they were not listening and where trying to either take his food and put him out the McDonalds.  My question is does it matter who paid for the food?  It was not stolen.  He seem to have a receipt.  If the food is paid for you should be entitled to eat it no matter who paid for it.  If you are going to have a restaurant in downtown Chicago, attached to the CTA  location, with four different directions to enter the McDonald's, you are going to get all types of people.  McDonald's should be happy anybody wants to eat their food.  Unfortunately, I loss my appetite and left.  I do not want to eat at a McDonald's that harasses their customers about who paid for their food.",https://www.yelp.com//biz/mcdonalds-chicago-199?osq=McDonald%27s
6,8/5/2018,3.0,"The only McDonald's that serves the global menu! They switch the menu from time to time, so don't expect the same things you see online. When I went, I got the HK style wasabi fries and Australian spicy buffalo chicken sandwich (which is pricer than their regular menu items). I ordered off the self ordering screen (which was nice since you could see all the options and take your time, therefore it takes awhile to wait in line).  The wasabi fries were def spicy. They give you regular fries with a shake bag and a package of wasabi seasoning. You were supposed to put the fries and seasoning in the bag and shake it to make them. Knowing how spicy wasabi is, I only put half the packet with the medium size of fries, but they were still super spicy. It evenly coats all of the fries well. I ended up not finishing the fries, because it was too much, but it did give a nice kick of wasabi -- similar to wasabi peas.  The chicken sandwich was alright. The chicken was crispy, but it seemed somewhat uncooked in the center. The chicken was soft and chewy, so I ended up not finishing the sandwich either. My friend said she order the same sandwich, but they ended up looking somewhat different (hers had bacon on it???)   Otherwise, the location was clean and there were nice tables and chairs (better than a regular mcd). Seemed like a lot of the workers go there to eat.

I ordered at the register and got my food before someone who ordered online.   Chaos on the ordering line vs everyone standing around to pick up food. People were confused on who was waiting for what.   We requested very specific sauces, but they gave no sauces to either of us then looked at us like we were crazy for coming back to ask.   ALSO my comrade was skimped out of a chicken tender on that 6 piece box so it was a very odd numbered 5 piece box instead.   Potential loiterer passed out on a table upstairs.

The windows were actually cooking me while I sat and waited.  I moved to another area on the second floor and noticed a not see clean person pretending to drink coffee.  The person would watch tourist seeing if they have an IPAd or nice cell phone to snatch up.

15,8/31/2015,3.0,"After needing a little something extra for lunch, a co-workers and I stopped in for a quick bite and it was fine.  Décor: It's a McDonald's, not much more is needed to say. It's relatively clean, well lit, and there are enough tables upstairs for a lunch rush. Bathroom: also relatively clean, but you need a code to open the door...  Staff: The cashier was fine. She wasn't overly friendly, or personable, but wasn't in a seemingly bad mood.  Food: It's McDonald's and that's why I love it! You know what you're getting and that taste... it's such a comfortable feeling chowing down on a McDouble and crushing a strawberry milkshake.  Value: Again, it's McDonald's. However, I hate when the Dollar Menu has items that are over $1. In fact, the ONLY item on this Dollar Menu that is $1 was a freaking ice cream cone! Now, granted, other items were $0.25-$0.75 more but still, it's the principle of the thing!  I'm a huge McD's fan, always have been and always will be.

When I placed an order for twenty Chicken McNuggets, I was politely refused, and told they weren't available during breakfast service. Dejected (and surprised, as I really wanted them), I turned to read the menu, when their manager said she could make me some, but it'd take time.

After taking my order, which was the easiest thing you could make (McChicken plain only ketchup and a Cheeseburger only ketchup), I waited, and waited, watched two of my buses go by, and waited. I got so fed up because after ten minutes of waiting for McDonald's, you're pissed off and I didn't want to miss another bus since the next one was in 15 minutes. I just told the cashier to give me the cheeseburger that was ready and that's all I wanted because I wanted to eat-n-go. I never received the McChicken and the only positive thing was that the cashier offered small fries to me, which was courteous. Mind you that the cooks already made two McChickens for the order after me, and those were ready before I ever received anything. The cooks could barely speak English, so I believe the language barrier impacted their understanding of all the orders because every order had some type of mess up, no joke. Upon opening and digging into my cheeseburger like a ravenous hyena, I came to discover that it had mustard and onions on it.

Definitely convenient if you need a quick fix at an odd hour due to an event or travel.  The inside was clean and you have the option of ordering off two self-serve kiosks or from the register. My boyfriend and I opted for the kiosks and moved to the side to collect our orders from the pickup counter.   My boyfriend got his meal within a couple of minutes; mine took closer to ten. There was a wait on hash browns - he must have gotten the literal last one since we both had them in our order.   I ordered a sausage biscuit with cheese, a hash brown, and a yogurt parfait.  + Sausage biscuit: I haven't had this since I was in elementary school, and it was surprisingly not bad. The patty had no weird bits, the biscuit was soft, and the added cheese was completely melted.  + Hash brown: straight out of the fryer and blazing hot/predictably delicious.  + Yogurt: this is the first time I've ever gotten one where the fruit isn't completely frozen. The juices make the yogurt appear a little curdled, but it was a small tradeoff to not have to crunch on frozen fruit.   The only note was that the super hot hash brown was placed in the bag with the yogurt - we were just walking next door so it didn't affect anything, but it would have made more sense in the hot bag with my sandwich.

This store was well run and spotless inside. Good management and employee selection here.  They had staff working the tables all the time to remove any refuse, and to clean up and prepare the tables for the next group. They managed this very well.

Came here a few weeks ago w/ my family on a Sunday night and b/c it was close to Michigan Ave &amp; located in the loop, we thought that it would be fairly safe. Wrong! Upon entering, we found a set of tables in the back corner to sit at &amp; within a few minutes we saw that there were some people standing outside looking inward at this skinny guy who was wearing all red w/ long dreadlocks. This skinny guy also looked back out at them, as if they were in some sort of communication. The skinny guy in red w/ the dreadlocks kept looking over at our direction &amp; seemed to be building himself to come over to possibly ask for something. He seemed hesitant but after about 7-8 mins, he starts walking toward our direction. Suddenly, it seems that he changes his mind at the last minute as he quickly turns around &amp; randomnly sits down across from an older man nearby our table, who is sitting by himself. The young man leans over &amp; whispers something to the old man, who looks terrified. The old man shakes his head but then goes into his pocket &amp; takes out some money &amp; hands it over to the young male. The young male then gets up &amp; leaves McDonalds. Literally, not even 1 minute after he leaves, an older woman comes in; she walks very quickly, slightly hunched over as if she is covering something in her hands &amp; goes directly up to a tourist couple sitting by the window. She slightly exposes the part of her sweater that she is folding up &amp; appears to ask them for something. This, on top of what had just happened, felt too suspicious so I immediately told my family that it was time for us to leave. Good thing I did b/c right after I said that, she came around the corner to our table and asked if we wanted to buy some chocolates from her. This felt very off since she was an adult, appeared to be in her late 50s, selling what appeared to be elementary school children chocolate fundraisers. When we politely declined, she gave a bad attitude &amp; mocked us. Fortunately, we were able to leave this place w/o any problems but on our way out, there was a bigger woman standing on the corner that kept eyeing us the entire time (particularly, my purse) which felt very alarming.

They are chatting all the time. I know because I am Latino and understand their conversation. One of the male workers there has the biggest attitude. I can keep going.

82,10/11/2008,2.0,"I love McDonald's.  Of course I was the victim of busy parents and busy schedules with lower-middle-class incomes leading to drive-through McDonald's goodness several times a week growing up.  I refuse to think I'm hooked, because I can quit any time.  And I will go for weeks without a visit nowadays, even months.  And frankly ever since that Supersize Me movie came out and McDonald's starting attempting to ""clean up"" its act, I visited even less frequently because I don't like what's become of it.  They took away my right to Supersize and tried to bait-and-switch me by saying I had the right to get a salad or fruit slices instead.  They even had a quickly-failed promotion about giving away Fitness DVDs with the purchase of Extra-Value Meals.  McDonald's trying to pretend it's healthy is what is driving away the die-hard fans like me.  The reason why this one in particular gets only two stars is because it's just a bad place.  The register area is a joke.  Why would you have eight registers all across in a big line if you have a physical building that can't handle eight separate lines?  There's a pillar in the way on the left causing a line rift separating the two leftmost registers, and a building niche blocking more than two people at a time waiting on the far right registers.  What you're left with is a giant mass of people in the middle feeling like they're getting screwed by those sneaking to the left or right to flank them in getting to registers.  Add to this the fact that the typical format of register-working involves taking two orders, then disappearing for 3 minutes to fill those two orders, then reappearing to take two more orders and repeating the process.  This causes slow-moving lines and grumpy patrons.  Add to this the fact that even when only taking two orders at a time before filling them - they still screw up.  I ordered two Egg McMuffins and the Sausage Biscuit &amp; Hash Brown deal - FOUR TIMES - and three of those times my order was wrong.  The only reason why this place doesn't get only one star is Gabriel.  I don't know how to explain the phenomenon of ""the lone male worker outshines almost all the female workers"" that I've noticed at SEVERAL fast-food locations, but it definitely rings true here.  That one time my order was right out of four - Gabriel took my order.  Since then, I try to work my way into his line instead of those featuring women cashiers - not out of misogyny, but out of desperation to correctly get what I ordered.  If you're at this location in the morning on a weekday, aim for Gabriel, and give him a big thank you when he gets your order right - which he almost certainly will.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-chicago-48?osq=McDonald%27s&start=20
83,9/10/2009,2.0,"It's fast food, right?  Well... it's food, at least.  There are three McDonald's within two blocks of my work (maybe more for all I know) and this one has THE WORST SERVICE of any of them.  I understand the people working the counter are getting minimum wage or slightly higher and are not super excited about their jobs or innovating the industry.  But seriously, will someone take my damn order already!??  I can't count the number of times I have been here where I stand in line at a register and when I finally get to the front the person is running around without any clear direction running food to other registers for the people who arrived after me but were lucky enough to win the register lottery.  Multiple times I have had to get someone's attention and remind them that I am still waiting to place my order.  It's not rocket science.  Heck, it's not even science.  It's service.  Plain and simple.  Divide and conquer: one group of people take orders and another group of people run the food while yet another makes it in the back.  Sounds simple, right?  Well it doesn't appear so simple when you walk into this McDonald's.  I have worked in the food service industry as a waiter and I understand that people have different ideas on what is good service but one thing is always constant: greet your customer and communicate with them.  Let them know if you'll be a minute; inform them if there's a wait.  Whatever the issue just let them know; they'll appreciate you more for it and be more willing and patient to wait.  Other than the service this is, well, McDonald's.  Doesn't matter which one you go to you get pretty much the same thing.  That's the hallmark of their business.  The only difference is service.  So, pay attention franchisees: McDonald's may continue to get my money but you independent franchise owners may soon lose valuable customers with poor service.
