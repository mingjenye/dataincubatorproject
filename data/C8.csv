Let's say I'm just ordering a drink. Because they keep their cups behind the counter, I still have to wait in line for my cup. That defeats the advantage for me to use the kiosk. If I have to wait in line anyway, I might as well place my order there too. If they either moved the cups so that we can get our cup after we place our order, that would change everything.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-auburn-26?osq=McDonald%27s&start=0

Once the server realized what happened she took the food and grew it away, even after I suggested to just leave it for he family.   After getting our replacement meal, everything was warm.

6,0,8/21/2017,3.0,"Honestly, we were looking for a different fast food restaurant, but we quickly settled on McDonald's in Auburn near the Target on Bell Road. This location has the new modern look with the upgraded interior and electronic signs. Access is a bit tricky with several driveways leading to specific restaurants, but you can drive around to find the golden arches.  McDonald's strength is consistency. Their weakness is variety. I have tried many of their new menu items, but always come back to the classics. McDoubles, Chicken McNuggets, Fries, and $1 drinks and coffee are their best. This visit brought me back to the simple pleasure of a Quarter Pounder with Cheese. A good lunch to start a great day.  The interior has been improved, although the restrooms are still classic. Service was quick and accurate, although I am not a fan of having to wait for the electronic signs to cycle between options.

11,0,9/8/2017,1.0,"Everyone is usually pretty nice there except I have noticed there are new people working at this location. I have two incidences where the employees were being extremely unprofessional and rude.   #1 this happened about a week ago. I was in the drive thru and I happened to order two drinks on top of the burgers that I had ordered as well. After I paid I got to the second window realizing that I didn't have any cup holder available at the time, so I proceeded to ask for one. The young girl that was working pulled her ear piece to say whattttt, so I repeated myself and she finally understood. As she gave me the drink holder I struggled a bit to put my drinks in there because I didn't want to hold up the drive thru line. As soon as I turned back the get my food from her she was literally laughing and making fun with the other employees and then turned to me and laughed in my face. It looks like she tried to hold back, but honestly it was extremely rude. So I took my food and went on with my business.   #2 happened this morning. My boyfriend and I were in the drive thru today and the woman who took our order was extremely rude as well. We ordered one thing because that's literally all she would let us do. I ordered a bacon egg and cheese biscuit, and I wanted egg whites instead of the nasty ones they put on it regularly and she yelled out our total before my boyfriend could get another word out. She never stopped to ask if we wanted anything else or just waited until he was at least done talking.  This issue needs to be resolved with these rude employees because it seems like every time I decide to go, thinking the service might be different...it's not.  I still have the receipt and I will continue to keep them and hand them into a manager and let them know their employees are terrible.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-auburn-26?osq=McDonald%27s&start=0

16,0,9/13/2016,5.0,Service this morning was phenomenal. The gal the drive-thru window and the counter was spectacular. She was massively over loaded with customers and worked flawlessly to keep them all satisfied and it rapidly serviced. Management should be ashamed at how understaffed the front counter and drive-thru window was this morning.  In spite of being drastically understaffed the team was able to take care of all the customers in a timely matter. Unfortunately the stress level was exceedingly high and unnecessary.

First was the order taker, yay! didn't have to repeat the order 5 times. Nice. There were five cars ahead of me, but I was amazed how fast the line went, it seemed like each car pulling up to the 2nd window, had their food waiting! My order was no exception, and the young woman was pleasant and smiling.  The shake was tasty, I expected it to be overly sweet and processed tasting, but that wasn't the case. The Big Mac was extremely neat and well put-together, not even a dent in the bread. Totally unlike other fast food franchises where the burgers look like they're thrown together by monkeys. (Apologies to Carl's Jr. employees, but I see now why they claim how messy their burgers are!)  Prices have gone up from what I remember, but it was well worth the increase.

They're quick to make good on mistakes on the occasion it happens (hey, places get busy cut them some slack) and Sue in the drive-thru is always super polite.   The not-so-good: Is their air conditioner broken? It's always hot and muggy inside, I rarely want to dine in and usually stick to the drive-thru but sometimes my son wants to visit inside.

32,1,11/15/2018,1.0,"Food poisoning. If Yelp would let me, I'd give this business MINUS 5 stars, but the lowest possible is 1 star. I purchased an order of chicken nuggets for my son. Poor little guy. Violently vomited them up that night. He was perfectly fine, having a great evening, until he ate their food. Same thing happened to Fred Q. 6 months ago, and island girl reported under cooked fries. Multiple reports of filthy conditions, inattention to delivering clean, safe, properly prepared food, accurate orders, all add up. DO NOT EAT HERE. This place is a menace. We're not talking about something that happened just once or due to circumstances beyond their control. For them, this is the normal course of business. As you can see, I'm not a frequent Yelp reviewer. We usually use my husband's account, and up until now, our standard rule was to only review businesses that merited 5 star review, so others could enjoy a treat too. If a business underperformed, or was average, we just didn't provide a review. But this business is not just underperforming. They made my son sick. NO ONE SHOULD GO HERE. Apparently key people at this franchise haven't connected the dots that their actions and, or omissions, can hurt, seriously hurt.

Im glad they started making more than just coffee this way I can come with my family and there are more options for everyone and everyones happy. Sometimes it's hard to please everyone so Im happy whenever we can stop by the sane place and not multiple places.

I go up there to get it and realize there was no sauce, I grabbed some ketchup n proceeded to eat my meal. I realized the fries were not cooked well at all, they were very soggy and a couple of them were cold. The only good part of it was Bernard who really made the experience a lot better.

This McDonald's just doesn't seem to give a crap, however.  I can't tell you how many times I've ordered a Coke and the carbonation was off, or the water filter needed replacing (yep, you can taste it).  Today, it was the syrup that needed replacing.  I tell the drive through lady this, and what does she do?  She simply dumps my coke out, and pours another one.  Doesn't even bother to test it herself.   Doesn't try to check the syrup to see if it's low.  Just pours another one and hands it through the window without saying a word.

The frappe was started as soon as it came on screen and it was blended but didn't get poured into my cup a few minutes after I even got my food. I waited for about 8 minutes to get my food and my drink. When I got my frappe it didn't have the correct lid cause it seemed the manager wanted to half a** it and grab a dome lid and didn't even give drizzle and handed me a liquified blended drink. Large caramel frappe, no whip. Obviously it's too much to ask for cause the manager didn't care to look at the screen and read it, if he hadn't already cleared the order to keep the times down but even then should've had it memorized. Half minded, and Lazy is what I'd call it. Upon presentation an in tact straw wrapper on the counter and when I felt it was empty I asked for a straw and he pointed to the one on the counter which was empty and seen for himself when I had to show him the wrapper. The food here is lousy, the customer service is good with the younger people however the manager working that night was not good for business. It just baffles me how you could be so lazy I.

After countless incorrect orders, bad service, bad quality, I feel this is it for me driving around the corner for a Big Mac, I'll go across town for one because at least that store as well as the other stores owned by the company can at least give a decent product both food quality, as well as customer service quality.

As I was placing my order, she again didn't say anything, so I wasn't sure if she got my order right.

The manager was doing something else and when he came back to the register area, everyone went back to acting like they've been working.

This one, has an amazingly clean kids play structure with so many cool twists and turns that kids like to climb and hide in. Great place for parents to relax and chill while able to watch their children run and play. My kids love it here. We grab a bite to eat and then they run off their energy.  The employees are super nice and very helpful. Bathrooms are kept pretty neat and clean and should you run out of that much needed toilet paper, they're quick to respond &amp; refill their bathrooms.   Next is their food. Ok 2 thumbs way up!! The food is cooked really well &amp; their fries actually feel like their made fresh.  Best part...for all those coffee lovers...their coffee is done well. The coffee is important, taste &amp; all, but I believe it really depends on who's making the drink...the barista.  If they know how to mix it up, well...then there you have it. This is why this Mcdonalds is by far the best!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-roseville-16?osq=McDonald%27s&start=0
216,7,9/13/2018,1.0,"If the definition of ""insanity"" is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result, then I must be insane. Or at least crazy enough to expect that this McDonald's location's drive-thru may someday get its act together.   Although my youngest child is the only one in the family who likes McDonald's, I have rolled up to this location's drive-thru countless times. And honestly--no exaggeration--I am disappointed 9 out of 10 times. Whether it's discovering I'm missing a fork for my salad or hearing my child's shrieks as he bites into onions and pickles on his supposed-to-be-plain cheeseburger, the unpleasant surprises never cease at this location. (The walk-in aspect of the restaurant is fine; I'm referring only to the drive-thru.)   What do they expect folks to do in such situations? I've tried calling, but no one ever answers. Once, I returned to the restaurant and they said doing so is the only recourse (and that you need to present the problem in person within 24 hours of their mistake). Not sure about the rest of you, but there are reasons I opt for the drive-thru, and none are conducive to entering the store after I've driven away, i.e. I'm in a hurry, I'm in yoga pants, a child in my car has removed his/her pants. Have you ever tried to unbuckle multiple, hungry children from 5-point harness seats AND THEN walked them all safely across the parking lot?  Last night, I indulged my girl in a post-dance class happy meal (real ballerinas live off nuggets and chocolate milk, amiright?). Here's the timeline:  7:36pm - Pull forward into the right side drive-thru. 7:40 - Speakerbox talks to me but only after everyone in the left lane clears. And I'm even talking about those who drove up way after me. Confirm on the screen: one Happy Meal and one large UNsweetened iced tea...no ice (so that I can refrigerate and enjoy it the next afternoon).  7:41 - Pay and drop my $.03 worth of change into RMDH change bin (I hope the saying is true that every bit helps; that is an awesome charity). 7:49 - Tired of staring at the backside of the SUV in line in front of me, I phone the restaurant to see what's the holdup, even though I know my effort to reach anyone--especially in management--is futile. Rings endlessly.   7:51 - Finally get to the food window and ask why they didn't send the car holding up the line FOR TEN MINUTES to one of those ""My high-maintenance order is taking too long so I'll park here and someone is going to bring my order out to me while on roller skates"" parking spots. (Not true about the roller skates, but wouldn't that be retro-fun?) She said they already sent 3 cars to those 3 spots so they're full, and that I should have a nice day.  7:52 - Exit drive-thru and wonder at my view of 3 empty parking spots reserved for slow drive-thru orders.  2:10pm Today - After a long walk with the dog, I salivate as I excavate my large, no ice, UNsweetened iced tea from the fridge. The aftertaste from the first big gulp is...sugar. Why?!? Who drinks sweet tea in California?  The chicken place across the street has a drive-thru that runs as efficiently as a German train system, so they will now get all of my coveted post-dance drive-thru money. Their nuggets are better, anyway.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-roseville-16?osq=McDonald%27s&start=0

I ended up having to make eggs when I got home.  Our previous visit, the lid on the orange juice would not stay on. Granted, she did warn me. I'm not sure why she didn't try to find a lid that would stay on. During the drive home it popped off and spilled in the car. Also, I asked for a biscuit with just egg and cheese. The employee rang in a sausage biscuit with egg (minus sausage) and charged me to add cheese. Instead of doing Bacon, egg, and cheese (minus bacon).

Some a little faster and some are a little slower.  But today I decided to grab some breakfast because I was running extremely late and didn't have time to make something. And I was quite pleased on how friendly the drive-through staff were.   They greeted me with a good morning and said thank you many times. And when I was leaving they said and have a great day it's little things like that that make the place but much better. It's amazing how people in fast food and many lower paying jobs think that they don't need to be friendly. So when you find someplace that has friendly staff it's always a plus.

I made the choice to go to McDonald's because I had had a limited time item two weeks ago that I liked and wanted to try again. The Sweet &amp; Spicy Honey BBQ Glazed Tenders. They're essentially chicken tenders tossed in bbq sauce. When I got home and took the box of tenders out of the bag there was bbq sauce leaking from the box. I opened it and there was a pool of sauce inside and the chicken is not at all coated. It's like someone put some tenders in a box and then dumped a ladle of sauce over them. Not appetizing, and not what I ordered. My fries were also cold and rubbery. I called this establishment to address the issue and spoke with a young woman who identified herself as the manager. She listened to my frustration and then said ""so what do you want me to do about it""? Nice. Excellent customer service. I told her that I didn't want her to do anything but that I'm disappointed in my order and the way she chose to handle it. She told me that she would speak to her grill cooks about it and that was that.

He rudely asked to see my receipt, and said you didn't order it. I did order it, but the boy from the first window must've deleted it because he originally read off a large coke to me.  After charging me for my large coke, I'm getting honked at by the customers behind me and he's just taking his sweet time for one drink.

I was asked If I wanted a girl or boy toy.  I said boy.  When I get home, he has a 4 piece chicken nugget, apple slices that are slightly moldy and smelled terrible when opened, and a girl toy.  Mind you, a Mighty Kids meal costs more than a regular Happy Meal, so yeah it was only a two nugget difference, but I paid for the difference.

Hello? - nothing.  After the other car pulled up and went forward I became angry. I pulled forward and when I got to the window I asked why I was told to wait and no one came back, yet immediately served someone else.  The man at the window stated he had told me to pull forward. No, he did not.  And in fact if he did, why wouldn't he tell me that again when I started saying ""hello"" instead of just leaving me sitting there with absolutely no response?

It's actually been so long since we've have been here, that we have forgotten what it tastes like.  As we left my parents house, this locations was here.... just telling us to come in and see what we were missing out on. We pulled up to look at the menu... This location has 2 sides you can drive through. I don't know if it made much of a difference which side we were on, but you can't read the menu very well on the left side. It was just too far away...and yes, I have very good eyesight. As the woman asked us through the box what we wanted, we politely said that we needed more time. When we were ready a moment later, I said ""Hello, we are ready."" When she took our order, you could hear the frustration and impatience in her voice, as we told her we wanted only mayo, ketsup, and cheese on our McDouble. She said, ""So you want me to add mayo?""  Yes... She didn't say anything after that. We just proceeded to the first window. At the window, she kept saying, ""So you want to add mayo?"" Yes. She laughed as if we ordered a McVodka... and then repeated our order, sounding sarcastic. I instantly felt uncomfortable and asked her to get her manager. When the manager, Hannah, came to the window, Hannah asked what was wrong... I started telling her that the girl taking my order was making me uncomfortable by being sarcastic about what I was ordering...and of course, that girl was trying to talk over me. So I stopped, and asked if I could finish talking...  The manager, Hannah, was clearly not in control of her employee. This girl was unprofessional, and rude. She doesn't belong in customer service. I hope she is spoken to and/or written up.  Thanks for at least getting the 2 items I ordered right.... but fearing that this girl didn't care for her job or company, I didn't feel safe eating the food.

It's my opinion the management and cooks must be rich and don't value the fact that feeding 3 people a value meal now costs almost $30 hard earned bucks. They take zero pride in serving fresh food. Most times the food is cold thru the drive thru no matter what you buy and I only live 5 minutes away and by then the food is already ice cold so we almost always just go to the restaurant down the street off Zinfandel. If you want any chance of hot food just dine in. They like to do the old fast food trick of mixing old fries with new fries too. Most times I just go to the other location but we give this one a chance once in awhile since they're closer and unfortunately it's always the same old story. They seem to have a high turnover of staff too, even for a fast food joint, because everytime I've gone thru the drive thru its a different person each time. Last but certainly not least it's very frustrating when you order food and wait for what seems like an eternity but start thinking ""it looks like we might get fresh food &amp; they've fixed the problem yayyyy"" only to be letdown.

It doesn't seem like the management pays attention to trends i.e. morning rush, lunch rush, dinner rush. When I spent my time in the industry, that was one of the basic training topics taught early in management courses. That being said, im a little confused. If management receives that training then where is the action? If you know lunch time is coming around, why is there only one cashier working the front counter? If you know people can tend to come before work and or during their first breaks, why are you not better prepared to handle a large crowd of people? I refer back to my ""your busy"" comment to also bring up the fact that the busier you are, the more hours you are allotted from upper management. Sooooo if your busy enough to deserve the hours, use them! Dont skimp on giving ppl hours because you in turn, skimp on customer service. Your smak dab in the middle of one of Rancho Cordova's busiest business districts, schedule accordingly!! Most, if not all of us, are on a tight schedule and dont have the luxury to spend 10-15 minutes waiting while one employee scrambles to manage a line of at minimum 5-6 people. I also understand that I can take my business elsewhere to those that are more prepared to handle the rush because $8.77 for breakfast....from mcdonalds...is a little steep. I mean all i ordered was a mcgriddle meal and OJ. Speaking of, the MEDIUM OJ can fit inside my hand. Dont be fooled. Your paying $1.59 extra for a cup that fits inside mosts adults hands.

News flash guys we can see you standing around talking with the lights on, stop being lazy. One time we received a RAW quarter pounder. When I called the store the ""manager"" on dute didnt even apologize. There was a minute of radio silence. It took me sarcastically laughing and saying ""really?"" for her to say anything and when she did it was to ask if we wanted a refund or another burger. When my boyfriend went back she didn't even have the decency to face him. She looked at him, and told the cashier to issue a refund and walked away. Still no apology. After we emailed corporate we received a call from another manager finally apologizing. We were done with this location for a good while after that. Tonight we were hungry and decided to give them one more try. We ordered 4 double HAMBURGERS. We received 3 CHEESEBURGERS. Even the special notes on the wrapper said double hamburger, as did our receipt, if I wanted cheese I would have asked for it. So not only do the managers not care about basic food safety and customer service, but the workers at night are lazy, can't count, don't always adhere to the hours, and apparantly don't know the difference between a hamburger and a cheeseburger.

The food is okay, I mean, it's McDonald's, so it's going to taste the same but what got me is the way they operated. For instance, I would go through their drive-thru during lunch and order their chicken nuggets, only to get back to work and realize they forgot the BBQ sauce, meaning, they didn't even ask if I wanted any and I assumed this was just a standard item they would include. I called them once, asking them about this, and they said they don't automatically give BBQ sauce, even if you order chicken nuggets but they automatically include ketchup with fries. Really? So, they automatically ask you if you want ketchup when you order fries but no BBQ sauce for nuggets? That's ridiculous. What's the logic in that?

The soda fountain always looks like it needs a steam cleaning and I no longer get drinks here. They always pull a fast one and charge you for seemingly inane stuff. I was charged $.15 for mustard and $.25 for extra pickles. These are condiment not up-charge opportunities! It's not like I get a discount when I ask to to hold the mayo! All drinks are the same price but they hand out different sized cups if you ask for a large soda. I asked at the counter why the different sizes and got a shrug for an answer. This place is a constant reminder of why McDonald's is a dying establishment. Come to think of it, why hasn't this place already gone under? For nearly the same price places like In &amp; Out just kills any reason you would have to come here beyond the fact that every other corner seems to have a location. It's really down to nothing more than a better than average large cup of coffee for $1 that brings me back to this location. The staff is very nice though often on the slow side. The ""larger"" dude, who I suspect is the manager / owner, works hard but does little in his efforts to promote customer service or repeat customers.

445,11,9/23/2017,1.0,"Sooooo disappointed in this McDonald's. My husband and I just went here. We got there before closing hours, (there was a sign posted saying they are closing at 11 for maintenance) but the speaker was off. We waited for about 1 minute or so, no one said anything. We then proceeded to drive up to the window. We saw no one, we continued driving thru and upon arriving at the last window, we saw a man and woman. My boyfriend was able to get the man's attention, he began to approach us. As he was walking toward the drive thru window, he was talking to the woman. We were able to read his lips, we could see he was using profanity. Once he was at the window, we were greeted EXTREMELY rudely. He opened the window and shouted, ""WE'RE CLOSED!"" Waking up our 3 month old daughter. My husband calmly said ""It says you aren't closed until 11pm."" He snapped, ""Our equipment isn't working. We're closed."" At this point I was extremely frustrated. My daughter was now awake (sleeping has been difficult for her since she recently began teething), and we were being treated very poorly by this man. We were hungry, we simply wanted to stop and eat on our way back home in the Bay Area. Luckily, my husband remained calm and asked to speak with his manager, if he/she was present. The man pointed at the woman and said, ""that's her."" She just starred at us. She didn't approach us or do anything. So we asked for her name, apparently it is Ricky. I don't want Ricky or this gentleman to be fired, I am just hoping they can be retrained in some way.

Since I was (miraculously) able to wake up and get ready in time, despite my nodding off to sleep around 1:30 am, I was on the road and turning onto the street to my place of work.  Hmmm.  McDonalds.  Now, usually I reserve a special place in my heart for their fries.  Yes, I confess, I am a french fry addict about once a month when I need to become submissive to my needs and acquiesce my taste buds for the habitual shot of salty-savory and sweet stuff.

Typical of my handyman father, he was in the middle of fixing a broken pipe in his garage when I got there, so I left fairly shortly after I arrived.  I hop in the car and it is unusually warm for November...I feel warm so I take off my jacket and realize I am in serious need of a big ole Diet Coke...not a can or a bottle either, but a fountain Diet Coke drink   Quick mental assessment: McDonalds is the closest establishment with this type of offering (and a damn fine one at that, maybe the best fountain sodas on the market in terms of consistency in the carbonation/syrup mix).  I enter the drive thru. It is 12:10 PM - prime lunchtime and the drive thru line is 7 cars deep but I am gabbing away with my sister not paying much mind to the fact that I am actually starving entering a McDonald's drive thru and definitely not weighing the potential repercussions. My turn nears so I jump off the phone with Rose, and I pull forward to gaze at the beautiful menu boards.  ""OH SHIT! I am hungry!"" I am an alcoholic entering a bar; a drug addict entering Lindsay Lohan's house; a sex addict on Craigslist casual encounters. My mind says: ""soda only, soda only, soda only. "" My immediate thought is to get French fries too (truly the tastiest item on the McDonald's menu in my opinion), but after years of counting calories I know a medium fry is pushing 400 calories and I just can't do it. I am pushing and pulling in my mind whether or not I should get something, and then I see it: The McRib. It is a novelty, rereleased for a limited time. I missed it the first time around in the early 90's, and loved the parody on the Simpsons when Krusty Burger released the Ribwich and Homer became a Ribhead, traveling around the country following the sandwich like the Dead. I am a poser for loving that episode so much without ever even trying the deliciousness that spiraled Homer down a Requiem for a Dream-like psychedelic wormhole. Hell, NPR even did a fun story on the McRib's rerelease recently, interviewing hip bloggers about how quirky and strange the sandwich is, with its nomadic history and Frankenfood mystique, framing it as almost a piece of Clinton-era pop culture when flannels were cool, SNL was good and Frankenfood had silly, manmade meat-bones, not modified DNA.  ""Order a McRib. Do it for the irony. Do it for the reminiscence. Take a bite of Blossom, 90210 and Saved By the Bell, blended and molded to resemble a rib and drenched in BBQ sauce.""  So I ordered. But apparently I wasn't the only Rancho Cordova McDonald's patron desiring a throw-back sandwich because when I pulled up to acquire my McNostalgia I was informed that the ""ribs ain't ready yet."" So, I pulled forward in the fat of the drive-thru (you know, the turnout area where you wait for them to bring you your food - usually it is for hot fries). I am waiting and I see a man that looks like Mr. McGoo pull in. He is old and despite the fact that his window is rolled up, I can smell 50 years of tobacco in his skin. ""He wants a McRib too, I bet."" I start doubting myself...what am I doing? I hate McDonalds. I am better than this. I can wait for ""real food"" (a term my Health Nut stepmother used to use that would drive me crazy as a child but now makes much more sense to me).  Then, the final straw: a 1994 (no, the irony was not lost) Plymouth Voyager comes hauling ass around the corner like a bat outta hell. The driver and all occupants are fat and fiendish, $1.99 in hand and ready to get at dat rib.  ""I can't do this!""   With the same intensity as that minivan, I burn rubber out of my Drive Thru holding zone, thinking not that I wasted $1.99 but that no food I eat should cost $1.99 anyways...it's like putting AM/PM regular fuel into a Ferrari.  As I am pulling away, I see the female McDonald's employee running to my car holding the small, white, folded bag. She must only assume that I am angry for waiting so long. She holds up the bag, raises her eyebrows and shrugs her shoulders as if to say ""Here it is! Come back! What, you don't want it?""  No, ma'am.

483,12,10/25/2017,3.0,"Was my Saturday night dinner. I had an interest in their new buttermilk chicken strips so I ordered them. I asked if the 10 piece came in a meal and she said yes, so I asked for the 10 piece. So it was $9.99 and around 10 bucks or so after tax.  So I asked them where is my drink and they said what do you mean? I told them you sold me a meal and it comes with a drink, correct? Wrong. They fed me the wrong information and had me purchase just the strips themselves.   They did not listen very well at taking orders. I was only compensated a free large drink for their order inaccuracy. The strips were good though, was full after a few and saved some for later (Had a microwave in the motel room)  This location needs an upgrade too and has the older style soda machines from the old days. Not modern like the one on Sunrise and Old Auburn. If you're looking to dine in here, good luck it has very limited seating and is more meant for a drive through experience.

I have been to this store several times before but always used the drive-thru and been generally pleased with the friendliness and service. This time I decided to go in to order and eat out front because it was such a nice day.   I walked in and there was a man waiting at the counter to order. Waited behind him for 3 to 4 minutes before he got pissed and left the store. I wait another minute or two and there are now 5 people behind me an have yet to be acknowledged by any member of the staff. I then said in a voice loud enough for all the front staff to hear ""Do we need to go to the drive-thru to get helped?"" Then an ""assistant manager"" type immediately took my order and all those behind me. All of them got their orders before me because of a problem with the frappe machine. (Oh yeah, you need to refill it when it is empty).   I guess the moral of my rambling is: Don't go in. Use the drive-thru.

528,13,11/10/2011,1.0,"When you enter a Walmart Supercenter, your expectations are low.  When you visit the McDonalds inside a Walmart Supercenter, your expectations are extra low.  My extra low expectations were met when I visited this McDonald's.  The store space is especially condensed; when I stood in line for 20 minutes to be serviced, I started in the superstore itself when I took my place at the end of the line.  20 minutes was a lot of time for fast food.  After around 10 minutes, it ceases being ""fast"" food and becomes just ""food"", but I was hungry and I needed to eat very badly, and I was trapped in the Supercenter--and since Walmart's Ruth Chris's steak house has not yet premiered, that left me with McDonald's.    During my 20 minute wait, I had plenty of time to study the menu.  I just wanted 10 chicken Mcnuggets, but that wasn't on the menu---although they had a 20 piece of the menu.  The 20 piece was $4.99.   When it was time to place my order, I smiled hello to the woman working the register.  She did not smile back.  I asked if there were any nugget portions other than 20 piece that could be ordered, as I did not see any others on the menu, and she said that they sold a 10 piece.  I said that I would like to order a 10 piece.   So she rang it in and it came to $4.09.  Since I could basically double my order for $0.90, I figured that I could at least treat my dog to a chicken nugget meal for $0.90, so I immediately apologized and told the cashier that, on second though, I'll stick with a 20 piece.  She rolled her eyes at me.    I appreciated that she rolled her eyes at me.  It was a fair reaction.  After all, she carried the enormous burden of pushing two additional buttons as a result of my unforgivable recklessness, and since she has a 9th grade ""streets smart"" education courtesy of the Mexico City public school system, whereas I wasted my time in graduate school earning my Doctorate, I am the stupid one for not meeting her expectations as a customer.    In fairness, I do not know her actual level of education; for all I know, it is entirely possible that she earned her GED while in prison.  It is really not an issue either way, so I do not intend to distract from the message with that discussion.  I provided exact change.  This also appeared to bother her by the annoyed deep breath of frustration that she took when I paid, but I could be mistaken since her emotions were somewhat masked by the fact that she had no eyebrows except those that were tattooed or drawn onto her face.  I say ""tattooed or drawn"" because at this point I was more concerned about what they were doing to my food than adding details to the list of visible defects on this woman who's life clearly took a tragic turn at some point early on.  I made it through the transaction without elevating the ill-feelings against me from annoyance to contempt, which meant that my food was not likely to be deliberately contaminated with things I probably can't even imagine.  I was served and I left the restaurant with my to go bag.    Naturally, it turned out that she gave me only 10 nuggets.  I don't know what it takes for a McDonald's Restaurant to go out of business.  I have never seen it happen, so I can only speculate that they are inherently profitable and they can stay in business no matter how crappy their service is.  Still, I would like to send a message to the management of this particular restaurant that even though this is is a McDonald's and even though it is in a Walmart, there are enough people out of work right now that you don't have to settle for just a pulse when screening potential job applicants.  To everyone else, if you are in this Walmart and considering eating at the in-store McDonald's, don't.",https://www.yelp.com//biz/mcdonalds-sacramento-25?osq=McDonald%27s

While I waiting for my food another patron pulled out a taser and decided to shock it at another patron. None of the employees did anything at that time and it seemed like a joke. This mc donald's has a children's play land and so you would think that the smart thing to do would be to bad someone who uses such poor judgement around children and the rest of the patrons. It seems mc donalds General Manager Bailey is not very good at her job. She is also unprofessional and doesn't return calls. When I finally got her on the phone she confirmed she didn't return my call and said she was so busy she forgot. This shows her incompetence as a general manager. Isn't one of the responsibilities of the general manager to return patrons calls, especially if they involve a serious matter. I think she is lying and was just too unprofessional to return the call. Please avoid this store as it was dirty inside the store too and the drink machines were very dirty and half of them didn't operate when trying to pour my soda. Save your bodies and just stay away from Mc Donald's from now on. I know this is hard since we have an obsession with unhealthy food in this country but I strongly encourage anyone who ready this to stay away from this store.

Window 2: {stretches out finger tips}. ""Is this your drink?"". . .tf? You tell me. The young man then peeps inside bag, hands it over. I inspect the bag too. ""Excuse me sir, doesn't an order of apple slices ($1.00/charge) come with 2 bags not 1?"" He looks very confused. ""I don't know, did you order apples slices??"" ""Uh, yeah"" Looks over his shoulder, yells behind him ""How many apples are sliced?"". . .wth?? ""No you're not understand me, you charged me $1. I'm asking if that is for 2 bags or 1?"" THEN a black button up shirt gentleman. I'd assume is a 'manger' or a 'shift leader', whatever the McDonald term is, yells out, ""What's her problem?!"" Closes the window. They converse. Young man returns, ""Do you have a receipt?"" Hands receipt, then manager yells just give it to her. Doesn't return my receipt (he balled it up). Young man hands over 2nd bag of apples. I concluded with, ""Ummm and you didn't put my sauces in the bag."" Blank stare. ""Yeah it was also stated on THAT recipt"". By then I'm livid at the level of difficult a simple lunch run has become.   The Meal: Ugh! Maybe the young man at Window 2 looked so troubled because he consumed half my fries. And filled them back with the fresh Casper fries! Or maybe because he drank my sweet tea and replaced the missing contents with tap water! (See photo evidence.)

No. Coupons were expired, so luckily I had a signed letter from  the manager with me when we went, so they reluctantly agreed to honor them.

598,15,10/14/2012,3.0,"I've been this location several times in the last two years because it's close to my job. This review is about the service, food, and amenities.   Food:  I've had my fair share of cold/burnt Apple Pies over the years at this location seems to always have cold/dry (rarely fresh) pies. Maybe it's just my luck to order the last two before a new batch comes out but it's been a consistent theme at this location. One of my McChicken sandwiches had a small sprinkle of lettuce (literally 2-5 small pieces of lettuce) and a blob of mayo on it. WTH?  What can I truly expect from a fast food chain like McDonald's? It's a 50/50 chance with any McDonald's location so choose wisely.   Service:   This location always seems to have ten employees working in the back; however, it's still one the slowest locations around despite all those workers. I will say that I've always been greeted with a smile (mostly by the women) here so that's a plus. I would also say to expect to wait a little longer at this location when it comes to actually ordering your food because there always seem to be some 'technical' issue. I waited an extra 5 minutes because the cash register (computer/card reader) reset and no one knew how to fix it, so they only took cash. I totally lucked out that I was paying for cash that day or I would have wasted almost 15 minutes off my 30 minute lunch just standing around in a McDonald's. That's not very cool.  Amenities:  This location has free WiFi so that's a major plus if you are a student or working professional who always has to stay connected. I can actually still check work emails and Facebook updates w/o burning through my data plan and enjoy music (the music here isn't bad at all). I always see people with their laptops working and ""chilling"" (coffee shop vibe-at a MCD's) which makes me feel comfortable to just sit back relax and enjoy my meal before heading back to the office. There is also a cool playground for kids to play while parents enjoy some good conversation with friends (still keeping on eye on their children) or taking a quick breather before heading back out on the road.   Overall, I don't think this is a bad McDonald's location at all. It has its pros and cons like all McDonalds do but it has the potential to be even better. Will I come back? Of course I will!

However, the Playplace as a whole leaves a lot to be desired.  The day we visited, the automatic sliding door wasn't functioning.  Kids would either try to slide the door closed, or would run through the open door into the ""adult"" dining area.  Neither is very safe. Perhaps the situation is temporary, although if the door is fixed I'm thinking that kids would then play with it by making it open/close automatically.  Also, a lot of trash accumulated on the tables and ground that people should have tossed into the garbage cans, and no McD's worker came by to clean the place in the 30 minutes we were there.  Most importantly, the 24 metal revolving chairs fixed to the ground are dangerous.  See uploaded photo.  The chairs have no stops to limit the amount of swiveling to, say, 90 degrees.  Therefore, a small child can easily smash his/her finger between a chair and an unmovable table, which is exactly what happened with our kid.  The potential for injury is unacceptable.  If you go to the Playplace with an active toddler, sit in the booths and make sure the little ones stay away from the rotating seats.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-carmichael?osq=McDonald%27s&start=20

We were given a TMNT toy, which is okay we're not mad about that, but we weren't given a drink at all.

For the remainder of the evening we both had intestinal pains. Today I had to pick her up from school, she had a big ""accident"" in her pants. This has never happened before.

674,17,6/29/2018,3.0,"Went in today and tried using the self ordering kiask. At the end of my simple 6 piece (one sauce order) of Chicken McNuggets, instead of the screen giving me the ""done"" option, I was only given the choice of ""cancel"" or ""order more,"" so I asked for help. The guy in front didn't know how it worked and had to get the help of a lady (mgr?) who totally ignored his inquiry at first. Then she came around the counter and helped me. I gave her my feedback. The kiask was new to her as well. By the way, you have to hit ""order more"" to find the ""done"" on the next screen.  I had wanted to use the bathroom before I ordered when I first came in, but it was locked. All I saw was the mean spirited sign: ""for customers only,"" and figured it was occupied/in use.  It wasn't, but how was I to know this (being my first visit to this location)? It was just locked.  How are customers to know someone isn't using the bathroom when it's locked and there is no sign!? When asked to use the bathroom, the same guy that didn't know how the kiask worked, also didn't explain to me that I would be buzzed into the bathroom, so I thought he was coming to open the door. This buzz in idea, with an unfriendly ""customer's only"" sign,  needs to be stopped. Leave the bathroom doors open and just have the crew check on them regularly. Or, have employees let people in with a key, or hand held remote control, making sure customers get into your bathrooms quickly. I give high marks to the guy who held the front door for me as I was leaving as he took out some garbage at the same time. There was a french fry, a straw,  and what looked like a breath mint container,  scattered on the floor around my eating area.  People should be on top of picking up stuff like that immediately, as they spot it (like I was able to do) on the floor.  Also, don't clean/spray Windex on the windows when nearby customers are trying to eat. No one wants Windex overspray in their food.  This should be done when customers aren't eating, period. The guy who offered to hold my food behind the counter for me,  so I could first use the bathroom, and who agreed with me about the bathroom ""buzzing in"" confusion,  ( there is no sign on door explaining) understands customer service better than anyone in the store. He acted like he really cared. That goes a long way with me as I know how minimum wage jobs can be challenging. He was a younger white guy with an earring in at least one ear.  He's your best person for understanding customer service.

So I said I will wait, waited up to 20 mins and then finally I couldn't hold it any longer so I ended up going in and asking for my food since I waited an extra 8 mins after the original 12 they told me and they tried to act like they were just about to run it out (more like they forgot and my face was the reminder).

I was angry so I went outside to grab my receipt and seen the guy walking out with the same exact bag and same exact food they accidentally gave me and they were gonna give it to the other guy! I told them hey I ate from that bag you guys should be giving that same food out. Anyways I grabbed my receipt and got a refund even before I received the food.

718,17,4/13/2008,1.0,"~Mc Cafe~  Ok, so who in there right mind needs to review food for a McDonalds? If you dont know the food at one, you obiously live in seculsion.   This review, on the other hand, is a review of McCafe, and by that I mean the new specialty coffees offered by McDonalds. Now I have my own espresso machine, and hold a high standard to what I call a good espresso drink. My default drink is an iced white mocha. If you know anything about a white mocha, the best ones are made with powdered white chocolate, not syrup. Dont worry though, McDonalds doesnt offer a white mocha. You can however get a regular mocha, latte, or even a vanilla, or carmel, version of these popular drinks.  They use a fully automated Bean-to-cup espresso machine, which I was dually impressed by! I'm not sure of the brand, but it looked top notch, and I figured this would make the drinks highly consistant.   I opted for an iced carmel latte for $2.79....   First one was made with waaaay too much syrup. Sent back asked for half the syrup. Still way too much. I couldnt taste the espresso or the milk. Oh well I gave them a shot...    Thinking the results from that spify machine should have been better, I decide to give them a second chance at this, so the next day I go in, but get more specific with my order....   Iced carmel latte, only two pumps carmel, and an extra shot of espresso... $4.79  Yea,,, $4.79? eh what?  Begin Dialog -  Me: after reading the reciept $1.99 for the extra shot of espresso, um excuse me, is this correct, you charge $1.99 for an extra shot of espresso?  Cashier: um let me check.... typing into cash register, yes thats correct $1.99 for an extra shot.   Me: um ok dokey... hope its delicious this time!  Conclusion... The machine looked promising, but dang its a NO GO Mickey D!   Theres a Starbucks two doors down.

I don't enjoy leaving reviews like this but the scales have been tipped. So going through the drive threw is always horrible here. I'd hate to see their wait times. But the main story. Got there, ordered my food and there was one person ahead of me. They had been sitting at the window to get there food before I even paid and even after I paid it took about 5 more minutes for them to get their food. When I get up to the window I'm handed my drinks which one was suppose to have no ice, but whatever it's ice. So still waiting a few minutes pass by and the lady asks me to pull around because my food isn't ready. My mistake was agreeing to that. I go and pull around and wait in their designated area......time passes about 5-6 minutes and I see 3 cars leave the dive threw and still no sign of anyone bringing me my food. I'm fed up as I need to get back to work, I only get a 30 minute break. So I go inside and tell them that I've been waiting for someone to bring me my food as it hasn't happened. I give them my receipt and they don't even have it started. Over hearing them talk about my order, they had given it to someone else......so I'm still waiting, watching about 5 other customers get their food...took about another 6 minutes for them to give me my food. They say sorry and give me a pie. I leave to give my boyfriend his portion of the meal that I bought. I only ordered 2 things a #3 and a #6. As I'm on my way back to work I get a text from my boyfriend. A picture of the burger that was completely raw on the inside. Really? I was livid at this point.

The burger meat comes out fresh as do the fries. Maybe it's under new management?   The employees in the past seem like they hate their job and have poor customer interaction skills. For example, I remember seeing a teenager put her skateboard on the table and an employee said in a very firm manner, ""Take that skateboard off the table now."" The teenager was in the wrong but she could've been corrected in a less demeaning manner. A please and thank you would have helped with that. The employees are always in a hurry to be done with you and get to the next customer before you can thank them. The customers don't seem to come first here. I've seen employees not hold doors open for customers who were right behind them.  Recently, however, I've noticed most of the employees have a great attitude and seem to be enjoying themselves. One example, I was rang up by a cashier named Don. Great posture and attitude, articulate with his words, and a genuine smile. I thought I was at Chic-Fil-A.

All they seem to care about is drive times and break times. I was made to wait five minutes before a staff member even came to the counter and when I tried to give my order he said he wasn't taking my order and walked away. Then I asked to speak to the manager and that was a big joke. The manager was rude and argumentative.

Meaning in a sense; give me ur money and leave. But places like these can b so much better if they only focus on it. Owners are afraid to b in the area and I don't blame them. But let's get to the point; Managers treat their employees like animals. Instead of teaching the employees, u often just see managers just yelling at them. I hate seeing that I'm hopeless in a helping hand because it's their freedom of choice. Managers are stressed because the business is completely greedy about ""their"" money/profit share; Their favorite word ""labor"". Leaving managers with barely the legal limit of bodies to work with. Everyone doesn't want to b working there, they just think ""they're trapped there.""  Ok let's go to food. Pretty normal McDonald food. I get the picture, I'm not there to get a five star dine in, so my hopes aren't high. It's similar to most McDonald's I go to. But I have been to a unbelievable McDonald where the bathroom was actually clean and the employees smiled at me and actually took their time to get everything I want. When the food came out it was like an artwork and the managers actually come and greet u. Btw it's the one in west Sacramento. Blah blah blah. I know my words won't reach u guys but I can clearly see an opportunity of change. Sale ur franchise to someone that actually cares. Hire strictly and train beautify.

This particular McDonalds' drive thru is terrible.  Some of the workers are nice and know what they are doing, but some are just incompetent and so slow.  First off, if you drive up to one of the two drive up speakers first, it doesn't guarantee that your order will be taken first.  Once they take your order, they may or may not have what you want (i.e. they may not be able to make an Egg McMuffin because they are out of eggs... the coffee machine is broken so they are only serving cold drinks...).  Once you get to the window, they usually ask you what you have ordered and then will scramble to just then start making your coffee drink.  If you order something with specific requests like an Egg McMuffin without ham, you may end up with an Egg McMuffin with ham and no cheese.

I originally ordered the Artisan Grilled Chicken, and the cashier talked me into bumping it up into a meal to save me money. I gave in even though I really didn't want a bigger size fries other than a small, nor did I want a drink. My total came to $10.26. I sat down to wait for my number to be called and thought how ridiculous the amount was for 2 things I technically didn't want and a damn chicken sandwich. I'm ballin' on a budget and trying to lose weight, so more fries PLUS a soda just wasn't necessary. Now, I hate being difficult at a restaurant because I know how it feels on the receiving end but I just couldn't justify spending well over $6 on a meal at McDonald's. Needless to say; I went up to the counter and stopped Latesha to cancel my order ASAP so as not to have the food made and potentially wasted. It was swamped in there and I could see how fast everyone was moving and I could feel the chaotic energy. But Latesha remained calm and polite, and got it done. I didn't have to stand in line again. She ran back to cancel the meal, came and asked if I would like something else. I gave her my new, smaller and obviously cheaper order, and she came back with the exact amount of change and a smile. A few minutes later, she had my meal ready and I was on my way home. I told her to have her boss check these reviews so he/she would know that she handled business, and remained cool amidst the craziness and my inconvenient ordeal. I placed a second order for another hamburger for my friend and the cashier, who was new, short changed me by a nickel. But I let it go when I realized after the drawer closed just because I didn't want to be more difficult. Maybe her drawer might be short tonight and my 5 cents made all the difference.

I told the lady we wanted a club chicken sandwich meal with no cheese ( #11). We also ordered a #3 meal and 1 apple pie.   Right after we had paid, the lady told me to park my car and wait outside in the front. "" Park your car and wait in the front."" I asked what do you mean? Do you want me to get out of the drive though? She looked at me with contempt and said ""yea"".   So I pull out of the drive though, and waited. It looked like they where kind of busy so I could understand why they told me to do this, however getting out of the drive though was a first for me. In addition, her rudeness was unnecessary.   After about 5 minutes another lady pops out with a bag of food, I waved to her and she came. She looked angry  for some reason. I asked her if this was #3 meal and #11 with 1 apple pie. She said "" its what ever you ordered, your orders in this bag"". After handing it to me, she went inside, no apology for the wait.  We received the following - Club chicken sandwich, 1 medium fries ( we ordered large) and the 1 soda we original got after paying in the drive though. There was a #3 sandwich, no soda and no fries. NO APPLE PIE.   So I get out of my car, go inside and explain to them what I got. They scrambled around asking each other if they had put an apple pie in the bag. After another 2 minutes of waiting, It turns out no one knew if an apple pie went in the bag. She gives me the apple pie but then explains that since I only paid for a sandwich I would only get a sandwich. No apology was given, excess time was wasted and they where beyond rude.  I understand they might have been tired, and busy. But why are you taking your anger out on me, especially when it was your fault to begin with.   So I get home to eat my #11 and find out there's cheese on it. I'm allergic to cheese and had to toss the sandwich out.   Never again will I go to this McDonald's. I will also file a complaint with corporate.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-sacramento-12?osq=McDonald%27s&start=60

I could tell she was getting frustrated (as I was), so she got tired &amp; left. Then it was our turn, we waited maybe 5-8 mins when the cashier came back. When she read back the order, she thought my bf said number 2 when he said ""sweet chili chicken mcwrap"" .... Where in the world did you get number 2? Then she was talking in a low soft voice to where you can barely hear her, close to a whisper!  After our order was taken, she went back in the kitchen to help a bit because they were sooo understaffed. You got 2 cooking, 2 in the drive thru, 1 cashier, &amp; 1 sweeping the floor..The line was getting longer, especially since school just got out. 2 ladies were waiting &amp; were also getting frustrated (along w/ everyone in line).

Also, for a long time they have had a homeless problem were homeless folks basically camped out in the lobby for hours and hours. Several of them stayed 24/7 with their cars in the parking lot.

920,21,3/22/2017,4.0,"My 950th review!  You know, I've actually remember going to McDonald's when I was a little kid back in the 1990s, and I was felt in loved with their Happy Meals every time of every month by giving a complimentary kid's toys and goodies especially for their burger and fries too. 26 years later as of 3/20/2017, I came back to revisit, and it's my first timer by coming to this East Sacramento's location! What does McDonald's do? It's easy because they serve the customers to taste and enjoy their well known fast food goodies from Egg McMuffin, the Big Mac (their signature favorite), delicious French fries, McCafe's coffee and smoothies and many more! The atmosphere and the concept remain the same as most McDonald's has across the world, and as for this location, it is very well spaced, cleanly and neatly without any debris behind.  The employees here are doing a great job for making the customers like me a fine service! Very friendly and approachable! No cons!  Now onto something interestingly good here! I ordered one of their limited time seasonal drink of Shamrock Chocolate Chip Shake in a small sized cup. It contains the remaining amounts of Shamrock ingredients filled with blended chocolate mint pieces and milk. It concludes with a top of whipped cream with colorful green sparkles. As I drank it, that smoothie was sensational! I can feel the flavors of both Shamrock and Chocolate Chip combined into a fantastical, drinkable dessert! Blended perfectly without the remaining chunks of ice cubes. Delightful!  There's a good amount of parking spaces available, so you can park anywhere you want near or far. Also, you can enter thru the drive thru area, so you can order your meals in few minutes. Finally, you can ride a bike, walk or public transportation too without the hassles and gimmicks.  All in all, McDonald's at Folsom Blvd in the East Sacramento neighborhood is the finest and the simplest worldwide franchise fast food restaurant that I've ever experienced. Perfect for all ages from young to old. ""I'm lovin' it!"" My rating: 4 solid stars.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-sacramento-7?osq=McDonald%27s&start=0

The dining area is dirty and looks like it hasn't been cleaned in several hours.  The worst part for me specifically, are the loud patrons in the back-corner of the lobby.  Every time I've been here around this time, there are 4 to 6 white men (approximately in their 60's &amp; 70's) who sit in the back corner of the lobby.  They are not rude and do not bother me personally, but they are extremely loud and annoying.  I'm on the opposite side of the lobby from them right now and I can hear there entire conversation like they're sitting right next to me.

I'm the first to admit my hypocrisy - shaming your mammoth empire and the drug you push while continually coming back for more. In my own warped mind, it only makes sense to review the local store I visit the most as some sort of compromise.   What's refreshing about this McDonald's is the human element. You may be ordering a carbon copy of the same assembly line ""food"" you could get anywhere else, but it's refreshing when the human being serving it expresses kindness and a personality. Those manning the drive-thru have always been quite friendly, even when lines of hangry borderline diabetics impatiently honk and rev their engines as they await their next fix.   This is also one of the cleaner McDonald's. I've been to other locations (namely the one off Alhambra) whose ""dining areas"" look like they were abandoned or turned into a makeshift homeless shelter.

I pulled up at 6:10am there card reader wasn't working (that's out of their control, I'm a reasonable person) so I went to the bank across the street and came back. I specifically ordered a sausage, egg and cheese mcgriddle and 2 mcmufins. My order came out to be $7 and some change. I gave her $20 and she gave me $6.98 back. As soon as I pulled up to the food window, I realized and notified her co worker. She takes awhile and comes back saying the girl at the register gave me the right change. Meaning, the girl handling money truly believed  $20-$7 = $6. I worked at KFC in high school and they had minimal requirements; know common sense and take/give exact change. If it were a couple cents or even a dollar I probably wouldn't have noticed or really cared to be honest. I'm not rich by any means(I used a coupon) but it isn't worth the drive back and hassling with people who hate their job to begin with.

The bathrooms were clean, probably the cleanest of any public place I've been to.  I ordered from one of electronic kiosks near the counter. I've never seen or used one. What a great tool to order and pay for food and drinks especially when one is in a rush. I don't know if it speeds things up for orders or cooking but it's simple to use. One can pay with credit or debit card or pay cash when they go to counter, simply taking the printed receipt to cashier.   The employees were professional, friendly and seemed to be working in sync with each other and the various processes. They were in updated uniforms (or maybe plain personal attire, I couldn't tell). The owner, I cannot recall his name, was a stellar example of customer service and represented McDonald's well! He had a can-do how can i help you attitude. I verbally provided my feedback to him. In addition to Yelp, I completed the online survey.  Outside there were parking spots for text/app ordering and meal pickup. He dining room was very clean.

An angry customer came in to complain that she waited in the drive thru for 20 minutes and they didn't put enough sugar in her coffee.  I was standing at the counter and was watching the employee that was assembling the sandwiches. Paint dries faster than she moved. I turned my phone on and started capturing the slowest crew I have ever seen in a fast food restaurant. There wasn't any supervisors in the area until 3:29. As they filed out of a room in the back the crew began to speed up. My #3 meal was handed to me at 3:34 pm.  I will return to this location because they are close to the place I do my laundry. And one can only hope the crew has moved on to new opportunities,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-sacramento-19?osq=McDonald%27s&start=20

Keep in mind however if this is why you're coming here but you must treat it as a public park there is no age restriction as the children who can play there and if you're having a problem with the activities of the children best to deal with them directly because management has nothing to do with it unless they are being hazardous to themselves or the equipment.

I drove back, parked, and walked inside.  I took photos of the sandwich and my receipt.  I asked to see a supervisor.  I showed her the sandwich, and she said curtly, ""I will get you a refund"". I was not offered an apology, an explanation, or free food.  She was very interested in getting me out of there quickly once I informed her that I would be contacting corporate.  She would not give me her name when I asked, nor was she wearing a name tag.  She was Asian and in her mid-20's.  Beware - I wonder how many other people got home and discovered that their chicken sandwiches had no meat.  They are cheating thieves!!!!  If McDonalds runs out of a product, they should take it off the menu - not try to pass something inferior and false off as the real thing.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-sacramento-5?osq=McDonald%27s&start=0

When u made an order, I was unsure of the food I wanted and made a change to switch from meal #9 to #10. I apologized of course to the girl taking my order. She didn't seem to know how to make the change request so she had to turn back and look for her manager for assistance.  I didn't mind, I figured she was new and is learning how to use it. But then I also thought they should be teaching employees this prior to letting them operate to prevent customers from being frustrated.   So the girl made the change with the help of the manager. She then asked if I wanted anything else. I asked for a peach and creme pie and she heard cookies and cream shake lol.. no biggie I corrected her again.  This was slowly turning to a strike as I tried to wait patiently. Finally she repeated my order and I told her it was all correct except I wanted my wrap without the meal. I thought this would be a simple request but sadly she did not know how to do that either... grrr. Once again she had to grab her manager's attention to assist her. I hid my frustration pretty well and thanked them both for their troubles and grabbed my number and sat down.   The food came quick.. they really uphold the fast food name! Took less than two minutes from my sense of time. I had my chicken wrap and pie nearly finished then I decided to take a look at my receipt. Oh no... as I looked at it, I saw she didn't completely void the meal. I was charged a soda cup when I don't drink soda.  I went back and showed her my receipt and let her know I was charged for a medium drink but never received one in the first place.  She asked if I still want it. I thought to myself I don't drink soda but I'll just fill it with water. So when I take the cup to the fountain machine. I was beyond disappointed to find there isn't a spout for water. :'(   Sadly this is by far my most disappointing visit.

I counted the drive thru cars being served to see if there was a difference. 8 cars were servered in my 10 min wait. Why???!! When I was waiting a gentelman entered the store who's order was also incorrect and waited for a long time to get his meal correct. Why? When I asked a person who looked to be in charge where my 2 Mc Doubles were she told my she didn't know and should ask someone else, instead of helping me the customer. Why? When I was finally fed up (12 min. Into my order) I asked for my money back. The person who said they didn't know anything was the person to refund my money. So it seems to me the manager at the time didn't care about me until money was involved. Why?

We ordered our food and waited for more than 20 minutes.  While I was waiting, i noticed that there wasn't any manager on the floor or saw any manager. Instead there was a white girl who was running the floor and she was scratching her head and touching her hair while she was bagging the sandwiches and hash browns for all of the orders that came up from drive thru. Finally waiting for a good 15-20 minutes, two managers walked in and they immediately took charged and was actually excuting the orders out for front counter. I was glad that the white girl wasn't touching anymore food because that was disgusting.  However, I still didn't receive my order while all of the other customers who ordered after me received theirs.  At this point I was furious and I asked the manager why i haven't receive my orders while everyone else who ordered after me did. I would expect her to apologize and give me my food right away. However she didn't apologize and rudely said that she dont know because she just got on and she walked away.

And also its location, makes it nice to frequent the place. Unfortunately, I had an unpleasant exchange of words with the store manager, BEATRIZ (she didn't give us her last name).  I had a prior incident with her at a different McDonalds branch (Laguna blvd, near target) where she gave me an attitude when I complained about a missing milk in my son's happy meal (it happens a lot, they often  mess up orders). Instead of being apologetic, she was so rude and bitchy. She even told me to call the corporate office if I had a problem, so I did. She probably knows that even if you file/call a complaint to the corporate office, nothing will happen. (She was correct!!!), nothing happened and she still works for Mcdonalds with an attitude. Since my son loves going to McDonalds for their toys in the happy meal and the play gym, I tried to ignore this BITCH. But today, at this McDonalds (arco am/pm -Sheldon rd &amp; 99), she's the one that handed me the cup for my drink and told me ""WHY ARE YOU FOLLOWING ME?! (with an attitude).  I am a paying customer, I'm entitled to eat at any McDonalds I want to go to. I don't get my food free. I PAY FOR IT. She even threatened me and my husband that she will ban us from Mcdonalds. REALLY???!!! As if I will loose a lot from not eating at McDonalds (everyone knows its the unhealthiest food on earth! But we do like it). This is a franchise store, so with this kind of employee, the owner will be the one to feel the heat or loose the income. I hope the owner of this franchise will find time to read all the reviews and see how fucked up all his/her employees are.   If I could rate this experience with a negative star, I would...  P.S. And to the store manager, BEATRIZ, please think about your employer. He/She has invested a lot of money into this business, you might only work there for a certain amount of time, but this business is their livelihood. This is the way they make their money, and they keep a lot of other employees there besides you.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-elk-grove-11?osq=McDonald%27s&start=20

Not a big deal u might think but when u are running late and rushing to get somewhere u simply don't have time to drive back curse the stupid employees out and get a damn apple juice! The second time I came here I ordered a #9 which obviously it includes the fries and drinks but when I pull up to the window to receive my meal I made sure to open the bag up before I drove off and guess what? My fries where missing!! Wow! Oh and it only gets better! When I asked for my fries it was like if I where asking for the whole fucken menu for free or something! The manager was a dumb bitch asking for my receipt which I automatically throw away so she prints out a new one and shows me that I didn't order fries.. umm hello?? I said a number 9 don't u know that means the whole meal??( Which I didn't understand how they managed to give me my drink and not the fries) so this lady wanted me to pay for my fries which I thought she should just give them to me for free since I waited for 20 minutes but I'm not that type of person trying to get a free meal out of McDonald's so I said yes I'll pay the difference to make it a meal so she want to charge me $3 more which was stupid because I had pay $6 dollars already for the burger and drink! So I said no honey I'm not about to pay $9 for a meal. So since they apparently don't have a braid I did the math for her and told her I only had to pay $1 and some change which I did and they gave me the fries. I was just in shocked that they had me go through all that bullshit just for some crappy fries and still had the audacity to charge me! Uugghhh!! And the third third time I went which was my last time I ordered my kid 2 beef patties with cheese because he doesn't eat the bread just the meat (he's a toddler) these geniuses packed the meat upside down which made the cheese stick to the cardboard box and left with nasty ass patty without the cheese, it was basically a cardboard cheese burger!

I asked 'so it expired 11/5 not 11/6 then' his response was ""yeah"". Very rude and not very informative. We've never experienced this at a McDonald's even at this location. Upset we cancelled our order due to the rude and very unfriendly customer service. I called corporate and Lewis explained to me that franchises determine whether or not the coupon expires the day stated or the day before. See all Mathew had to do was explain this but instead he gave us a very blank look and short answers that made us feel like we were clueless.

I get that customer service is hard, working at McDonald's is stressful and not all customers are nice, but her attitude towards literally everyone in the store was disappointing to me, not everyone is going to give her a hard time and she acted as if anyone even bothered to ask for some sauce or something that she might just blow up at someone, very intimidating and NOT FRIENDLY! When I went up she didn't not greet me, didn't say a word, just stared at me. So I said ""hello, I'd like etc"" (I had an easy order, only got a burrito) and she said ""we don't have that"" and I ordered one this morning. So I kinda paused for a second and asked as nicely as I could ""I think it's the sausage burrito breakfast thing"" she said ""oh"" and rolled her eyes. Then said nothing and pointed at the pin pad. It wasn't a horrible communication but she was sooooooo rude to the previous customer saying ""what do you want"", ""sauce!?"", ""pay"". Only words she'd said to that customer all while being very monotone and FULL of attitude.

1325,27,4/21/2016,1.0,"This would be ZERO stars, if possible.   I had just visited the farmer's market in the nearby parking lot with my toddler in tow. I had a dentist appointment coming up and realized I didn't have time to go home and make breakfast. I spotted the McDonald's which had literally not a single car in the drive-thru, so I decided I'd grab breakfast for us there. I pulled up, made my order, went to the first window to pay, had a short chat about how not busy they were, drove to the second window, and was immediately told that I would need to pull to the front of the building because I had asked for the muffin toasted well. I looked behind me to see not a single car and asked, ""Even if I'm the only one in line?"" He turned to a short woman behind him, who nodded her head, so he turned back to me and said, ""Yes."" So I pulled out to the front where 3 other cars were already waiting for the same kind of reason. Ridiculous! Not a single car in the drive-thru, but you've got, now 4 cars waiting out front on the red curb or blocking other cars because there's no designated wait area. I maneuver myself around and find a spot that I can be found by whomever comes out to bring me my food. I paid at 8:07am. I waited as I watched all three cars get their food and drive off. I waited as I saw people park, go inside, and come back out with their food in hand. I waited and waited, not wanting to pull my toddler out of the car just to run inside real quick - the whole reason why I picked the drive thru anyway.   Then, some homeless guy comes and starts walking around the area. He kept stopping and banging his fists on the ground as he yelled. I locked my doors, rolled up the windows, and moved a bit further up. At this point, I started watching the clock. At 8:15, I tried calling the store because I didn't want to leave my car (especially with my child in tow) with that man in front of the doors. It rang and rang and rang and then went to a message system. I waited some more. At 8:19, I had had enough waiting. I parked the car, pulled out my toddler, ran past the angry man, and inside. I asked if my drive thru order was ready yet. Everyone looked at me like they were confused and said, ""What did you have?"" SERIOUSLY?!?!?!? So I told them what it was and the little lady asks the ""kitchen"" workers if they had that order done. The girl back there goes, ""Oh yeah, I'm working on that."" As I see her grab cheese and JUST NOW start putting the sandwiches together (I had ordered 3 sausage muffins (no egg) with extra cheese &amp; bun well toasted). So I say, ""Are you kidding me? I've been waiting out there for over 10 minutes and you haven't even started my order? There wasn't even anyone in the drive thru! This is ridiculous."" So the poor guy that was told he had to have me wait in front asked what happened quietly, so I told him and I asked who the manager was and he pointed to the little lady who kept her back to me this whoooooole time. RUDE!   So I wait for my food inside now and with attitude she turns, hands me my bag, won't make eye contact, and goes, ""I threw in a hashbrown, sorry for the wait."" She says that without any eye contact, with a monotone voice, and it was very clear it was being said begrudgingly. I was LIVID, so I just walked out. I'm now running late, so I start driving and at the stop lights, I start opening the food. Do you know what I find? COMPLETELY SOFT, BARELY WARM BUNS. THEY WERE NOT WELL DONE IN THE SLIGHTEST BIT - IN FACT, THEY SEEMED UNDERTOASTED. If I would've had the time, I would've marched back in there, demanded it to be fixed, and quite possibly a refund for that insane amount of shenanigans. And do you know what? They cleared my order before having made it, so it LOOKS like they do great with their drive thru times. Not when you have FOUR cars waiting out front and not a single one in the drive thru. I AM SO PISSED AT THIS EXPERIENCE, MAINLY BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF CARE I RECEIVED FROM THAT SNARKY LITTLE ""MANAGER"" FOR WHAT HAPPENED.   I get McDonald's is not where you should expect great customer service, but this was unacceptable for *any* business.

My first order was 6 cheeseburgers, 2 mcchickens, 20pc nuggets, a snack wrap, one large fries and a drink. I got my order in 2 bags and I realized I was missing 2 mcchickens that I paid for! I told the chick at the window I was missing my two sandwiches from the order, first she said it wasn't even on the receipt which I presented to her afterwards. Then she closed the window and another employee came with the MOST attitude saying she packed the bags herself and put the sandwiches in there. Let me remind you, I have my 2 baby girls in the backseat just trying to get some damn food. The female at the window THREW the bag of food back into my car and shut the window. We paid for our food just like everybody else so we just wanted wtf we paid for! The manager came and was not tryna hear anybody out she simply said, ""well the employee said she put it in there so you guys can either leave or we can refund you."" So we pulled to the front to get our refund, the manager asked if we wanted it all back on my card and we said no we paid 2 ways and want it back the same way. She came back with our receipts and said she put it all back on the card and that she will not help us any further. Management is horrible, employees have no customer service skills, and nobody even gave the chance to hear what the hell we had to say. I didn't want to be the one to throw a scene over 2 damn mcchickens but I wasn't gonna have them accuse me or act like I lied about 2 sandwiches THAT I PAID FOR and did not get. The whole situation escalated when we got inside but all could've been avoided with better customer service skills. Especially that manager, I would've expected more from somebody at a higher rank!

Did I mention dirty?  I'm constantly swatting flies just trying to survive sitting here while my son eats slowly.  Tables are filthy.  Soda machines have stuff spilled everywhere and not cleaned up.  Soda lids are empty for the drink size I ordered so I had to dig around.  If they aren't cleaning, and aren't taking orders, and aren't producing food in under 10 minutes, then what exactly are they doing?",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-west-sacramento-4?osq=McDonald%27s&start=40

I had stopped after a long day to get 2 quarter pounder meals, simple enough. I was 3rd in the drive through, we had all waited about 7 minutes for the person in the front to get their order vs. having them pull to the front of the store to await their order. the person in front of me as well as my self had their food quickly meaning it has been sitting waiting for us for at least 5 minutes. The person at the drive through handed me the bag and stated, ""heres your food"" no thank you no review of the order. When I had gotten home we had realized the food was very cold, the burger was black from being over cooked and the bun was stale to the point of being hard and un edible. We both threw the food away knowing we weren't going to drive 10 minutes back to this location and put up with poor service again. I had taken the survey on line indicating they can keep their 2 for one deal I wanted a refund for the food I had to throw away, I had asked for a call back from the manager, this was 4 days ago. DO NOT waste your time or your money for rude service, no respect for your time or patronage. The food was so terrible I dont see how a location could be so inconsistent when they only have one menu to practice every day. I wish I could add an image of the blackened burgers and hard buns.

When the cashier brought the burger back, the person making the burgers said ""Oh, is he being difficult?""

No, it is not a health food restaraunt,but is a fun treat once in a blue moon for the kids for a job well done only to have service so utterly poor was a disgrace.I read a comment that all the West Sacramento McDonalds are privately owned and sounds like this behavior is acceptable if not tolerated. Well I'm sure ""The Big Cheese"" of McDonalds would be highly upset to see people treated this way and the food service industry be represented so awfully.

1457,29,7/21/2018,2.0,"I come through here and a couple other locations nearby, I'd say this is probably the second worst McDonald's in West Sacramento. I don't make super complex orders. Cheeseburger, extra pickles. Everytime I check it's only two pickles and they're about room temp. Instead of making a fresh cheeseburger with more than the standard two pickles, they give me the premade leftover cheeseburgers and slap a special order sticker on it without even squeezing an extra pickle into it.   It's been proven to me that it's literally too complex to factor in between 1 and 0 modifications to a burger with, at most, 6 ingredients. This is either idiocy, laziness or apathy, and if any of those are the case, I'd also be concerned about the state of the sanitation and whether the people preparing food know they can't skip washing their hands by spitting on them and slapping a special order ticket on them.  If you're the type to do simple special orders, or expect fast food to be faster than browsing a grocery store, finding your preprepared foodstuff and waiting in line stay far far away.

I got to work the mcmuffin was burnt, black and extra cripsy- the hash brown was cold and taste like it was cooked in old fish grease. and to top it all off the carmel frapp was more than extra blended it was blended into a form of a soup- a clear soup that is. everytime i give them a try it fails- i end up spending $8 on breakfast that i took two bites out of. and lets talk about the horrible customer service at the drive- thru- the first time i went in january of this year i ordered a carmel frap extra blended with extra carmel - i got to the window to pay she handed me my frapp it had whip cream on it and ice chips the size of cushed ice- i handed it back to her and told her i wanted my money back after she didnt try to persuade me to get another one she gave my money back and as i was driving away she yell GOOD RIDDENS!!!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-west-sacramento-3?osq=McDonald%27s&start=40

So that's exactly what I went with! They had 2 types of chicken tenders, Buttermilk Chicken Tenders and Sweet N Spicy Honey BBQ Glazed Tenders, so I got one of each. I also got some Mac Sauce on the side which was a good move! Each one costs around a little less than $5. I also got a Small Fries (~$2) and a free one! In total, this meal cost me less than $7 which is great. The only caveat with using the app is you can only redeem one coupon at a time, so I had to do this as two separate transactions, according to the worker.

But if you're going to treat me like I'm stupid and slowly read my order back to me very slowly...TWICE.... then this place is lost forever... it's a shame that I can get the same order from a location across town ( E.G Blvd East or Bruceville  @Walmart) and still have higher quality and hotter coffee by the time I  get to the office which is less that 300 yards from the Harbour Pointe location.... do us all a favor... close this location down... it's obvious  no one here cares... let a business that actually gives a damn about quality  and customer service  move in....,https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-elk-grove-7?osq=McDonald%27s&start=20

I came in earlier today for breakfast with a friend, I knew what my order would be and couldn't have imagined it to be such a hassle for the cashier.   The cashier was Alexander (Alex) who asked what I want to order in a stern voice, I simply replied in my most courteous and general manner, ""An order of the hotcakes without sausage and one sausage mcmuffin, I would also like to request a fresh order please.""  He looked at me dead center and chuckled a bit, then proceeded by saying, ""Well, it is fresh. What? Do you think it just comes out of a box?"" *chuckling continues*   I didn't say anything and just brushed it off, I couldn't even believe how disrespect this individual was. Honestly, customer service aside for a second, have you any decency? I was far more courteous than I usually am just because of the frequent discrepancies at this location. I then check my receipt and immediately notice that he put in an order for a Hotcakes w/ sausage order, c'mon. .   You want to disrespect me and then mess up my order? I made it very clear and there really shouldn't have been any confusion, it wasn't at all busy in front either.   I had to tell another girl working who then gave me a refund back on my debit card, which is quite a hassle because now I've got to wait to retrieve the money the cashier made me lose out on.  In short, I simply don't feel welcomed by this location in the slightest anymore. I'm just shocked really, to top it all off the cashier didn't even manage to press the ""ask me"" button which displays whether or not the cashier requested it as fresh or not.

1615,31,1/3/2014,1.0,"ELK GROVE - What was supposed to have been a happy meal at a McDonald's restaurant turned unhappy for a woman eating with a group of mentally disabled adults.  ""They're people like we're people, so they shouldn't be discriminated against,"" said Constance Gastinell who works with developmentally disabled adults through programs that help integrate them into the community.  Gastinell sometimes takes some of the adults to a McDonald's on Elk Grove Boulevard for lunch, but the last time they were there she says the owner kicked them out. ""He came in and he said, 'well you guys, you can't eat here, you have to leave.'""  She said the owner told her they couldn't stay because they were conducting 'business.'  ""We weren't conducting business. We came into eat. We had no paperwork; we had money to buy,"" said Gastinell.  But McDonalds says there was no discrimination. In a statement issued to News10, Dennis and Vicki Caldwell, the local owners of the restaurant, said, This recent situation involved a food fight within their group, and disruption to our other guests.  The Caldwells added it wasn't the first time such an incident has occurred.  We have consistently attempted to work with these guests and accommodate their needs as best we can, their statement read.  Gastinell says there was no food fight and her group was well behaved.  ""We went in to eat. We weren't disruptive,"" she said.  She feels they were told to leave because they were mentally disabled.  ""I did feel as though they were targeting us, although he [the owner] says that he wasn't. Being kicked out, how else are you supposed to feel?"" Gastinell said.  Soon after she was asked to leave, she rounded up her clients and left. She wants others to understand the stigma that surrounds people with disabilities.  ""When you see them hurt, it hurts you. That's why it's personal,"" said Gastinell.  While Gastinell says she will continue to defend her clients, she no longer plans on going to the Elk Grove restaurant.  News10/KXTV  - Having a mentally disabled daughter, Kathryn (pictured), this story drove me out of my mind. People have no idea how hard it is, just to go out to a store or restaurant or anywhere. We get the stares and the looks, sometimes from children, more often from adults. We've all seen the group of four or five disabled folks being assisted by a health care worker, going around a store to get some things or sitting at your local restaurant, just wanting to be like everyone else. I wish Elk Grove were closer, I'd like to chat with their manager. I hope ""big"" McDonalds is paying attention to this particular franchise, as how individual restaurants and employees treat guests is a direct reflection of the organization as a whole.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-elk-grove-7?osq=McDonald%27s&start=80

Posted drive thru hours are until 11:00 pm but if you show up after 9:00 pm it's a crap shoot if their open. When it is open I've never had less then a 10 minute wait. Employees are always rude and there is little to no supervision, in most cases (see below). Check your order before you leave because the odds are good that it's wrong.  Last night was the last and final time I will go to this location. I pulled up to the speaker and waited two minutes to be greeted. This is normal and actually faster then normal. Placed my order with no issues (not normal). Pulled around to find two cars in front of me, paid at the first window and took my place in line. The two cars were served quickly and I'm at the pick up window in the time you'd expect at a McDonalds. 11 minutes later I honk my horn in hopes of getting the attention of the three employees I've been watching screw around with each other and on their phones. One points and laughs as another grabs my bag of food which had apparently been sitting there for a bit, hands it to me and closes the window.  No drink. I knock on the window, she opens it and says what? I didn't get my drink I say. Well we're out of unsweetened tea she says. I guess I just don't get a drink then? I ask for the manager. Window slams shut and a guy shows up who says were out of tea what do you want me to do? How about give me my money back?  He gets another manager for the refund!

I'm sure the other reviewer just happened by on a bad day or something. As McDonald's go....this is a good one.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-reno-19?osq=McDonald%27s&start=20

While the decor at this particular McD's is nice, the place is filthy. Went with hubby today just to get something to drink. The self-serve drink station was filthy. Straw wrappers everywhere. The little white cups you put ketchup in were wet with old soda. None of the tables were clean. The bathroom wasn't much better. Plus, they seemed to be very short handed. It took about five minutes for the cashier to come and take our order, because she had to fill the previous customer's order all by herself. Didn't look like she had any back up at all.

As I roll up the window is open and I can hear the manager and the other employee helping her ""look for my food"" the manger realizes that she gave my food to the customer that was in front of me! She quickly starts blaming the other employee saying well she handed me the bag... so on and so forth then when the other employee states I gave u 2 bags I'm sorry u handed out both then manager quickly laughed it off and said I'm sorry I'm tired I only got 5 hours of sleep last night! Continues to complain about no sleep while me and other customers can hear them just talking while everyone is waiting on food!   She then comes and confirms my order to me and then walks over to tell the cook to remake my food! I continue to sit in drive threw for maybe 3 mins when she comes over and ""parks me"". I drive around the parking lot and park in one of their designated spots! As I sit I see customer after customer leave I even see other cars that were parked waiting for their orders come and go! My son starts crying wanting to get out of the car so I look at my clock and I had been waiting from time of order 18 mins!!!   I get out the car and take my son out of his car seat and have to carry him inside! As I'm walking inside the manager is walking around the counter with a bag so I ask her is that my order she gives me the dirtiest look and says YEA. And swings the bag towards me! My son is upset so I just grab my food and walk out! As I'm walking out another lady is holding the door open for me and states they messed up on ur order I said oh no I just had to wait for mine she continues to tell me that they did not give her her whole order and had to come all the way back for the wrest and when she did that the manager argued with her and then gave her the food in the end!   I get in the car buckle my son up and check my bag!!!!! The whole time I kept telling myself well at least with the wait I will have fresh food!!! Pssshhh yea right not here!! My frys of course were not even full and were cold as if they had been sitting in the bag the entire time not even under the warmers at the very least! The only thing that was warm was the chicken strips that I'm guessing is what took so long in the first place!   I get home take everything out and start serving up our cold food to find out NO NAPKINS AT ALL!!! Not even one!! Like really not only did u mess up u messed up bad!!! No sorry for the wait or here's some apple pies for the wait or maybe even here's some napkins for the chicken strips cuz they are wet and messy (tastes very good btw I would go to another McDonald's for these again)   I used to work at this McDonald's when I was young and worked here for 5 years and continued to work in the food/customer service industry for years and I have never ever given a customer a dirty look or complained about my life in front of them and how I'm tired that's why u have to be inconvenienced and wait for me to get ur food re made cuz I gave it to someone else!

I felt so bad for this girl and all she kept doing was apologizing to me. The manager went and got our order, again, just an order of two medium fries and tossed it on the counter at this girl while still talking down to her. I asked for the managers name as well as her own name and told her that I'd be making a complaint about that. Nobody should be treated that way. That poor girl was trying her best and handled that highly embarrassing situation far better than many people would have. The manager's name is Sam (I suspect short for Samantha) and is the worst example for what employees should strive to be. I do appreciate the lesson she gave to my 8 and 10 year old boys as to how NOT to treat people.

1724,33,1/23/2008,2.0,"Aw! Why not? There's a special 2 Big Mac's for $4... that's a pretty good reason to try McDonald's today. Two national fast food chains in a row... must be a trend.  If I had my druthers (and since the kids are grown) I'd frequent Jack in the Box or Carl's Jr over McDonald's anyday. But since there's a sale on Big Mac's... might as well sit down and do a review...  Big Mac's - they just get smaller and smaller and smaller every time I frequent McDonald's! (**)  Fries - the worst fries of any national fast food chain... fried to a crisp... excessive amounts of salt (*) National chain with worst fries than McDonald's: In 'N Out.  Coffee - I've read that to some people McDonald's Coffee is better than Starbuck's. Amazing, but true! I wouldn't go to Starbuck's, mainly because the price is so high. But McDonald's is just selling plain brewed Coffee, folks! That's all it is! If you want this Coffee, stay home and just add an extra couple spoonfuls of Coffee in your coffee maker. What I didn't like about my Coffee order - the cashier asked me how many sugars and creams I wanted in my coffee - I said three of each. Instead of leaving packs of sugar and vials of cream on my plate... McDonald's actually mixed it for me. That saves money for McDonald's in terms of waste... but what if I change my mind? (***) Can't give their Coffee more than 3 stars because I make just as good Coffee by staying HOME!",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-lodi?osq=McDonald%27s&start=40
1725,33,12/12/2012,3.0,"It's your standard McD's. The service is fast and the staff is friendly. The place is clean enough, although the last time I was there the restrooms were iffy. I go there when it's convenient. Nothin good or bad to say.",https://www.yelp.com/biz/mcdonalds-lodi?osq=McDonald%27s&start=40

1727,34,5/28/2018,5.0,Best service. The app made a mistake and we couldn't get what we wanted. The crews here helped take care of it. Five stars for the service and food - Big Mac and fries taste so fresh!,https://www.yelp.com//biz/mcdonalds-reno-26?osq=McDonald%27s
1728,34,11/17/2018,1.0,Stoped by last night after a long flight from New York and ordered some regular cheese burgers and a large fry in the drive thru. The line was long so I would guess that everything  being made was fresh and HOT. After receiving my order that was sitting on the counter by the drive thru window for about 4 minutes I drove off to my home. I live literally 4 minutes away! I opened the bag and to my surprise everything was ice cold in the bag! The frys were just plain nasty and the burgers weren't much better!!!!! I'm certain that I won't go back to that store again ............,https://www.yelp.com//biz/mcdonalds-reno-26?osq=McDonald%27s
1729,34,5/27/2018,5.0,"Went through the drive through, saw a crazy thicc squirrel doing karate with a plastic spoon. Hella tight entertainment while waiting for my fudge sundae. McDonald's knows what they're doing.",https://www.yelp.com//biz/mcdonalds-reno-26?osq=McDonald%27s
1730,34,1/24/2018,5.0,So as most of us we have been to a McDonald's. But it's almost 11am and i wanted a hash brown and the manager said she would cook me a hash brown if I wanted one. I was so very happy about it. Only downside to this location is that it's inside Walmart!,https://www.yelp.com//biz/mcdonalds-reno-26?osq=McDonald%27s
